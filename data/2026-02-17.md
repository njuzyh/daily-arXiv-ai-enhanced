Abstract: In this paper, we present a 2-local proof labeling scheme with labels in $\{ 0,1,2\}$ for leader election in anonymous meshed graphs. Meshed graphs form a general class of graphs defined by a distance condition. They comprise several important classes of graphs, which have long been the subject of intensive studies in metric graph theory, geometric group theory, and discrete mathematics: median graphs, bridged graphs, chordal graphs, Helly graphs, dual polar graphs, modular, weakly modular graphs, and basis graphs of matroids. We also provide 3-local proof labeling schemes to recognize these subclasses of meshed graphs using labels of size $O(\log D)$ (where $D$ is the diameter of the graph).
  To establish these results, we show that in meshed graphs, we can verify locally that every vertex $v$ is labeled by its distance $d(s,v)$ to an arbitrary root $s$. To design proof labeling schemes to recognize the subclasses of meshed graphs mentioned above, we use this distance verification to ensure that the triangle-square complex of the graph is simply connected and we then rely on existing local-to-global characterizations for the different classes we consider.
  To get a proof-labeling scheme for leader election with labels of constant size, we then show that we can check locally if every $v$ is labeled by $d(s,v) \pmod{3}$ for some root $s$ that we designate as the leader.

Abstract: We present a complete classification of the distributed computational complexity of local optimization problems in directed cycles for both the deterministic and the randomized LOCAL model. We show that for any local optimization problem $Π$ (that can be of the form min-sum, max-sum, min-max, or max-min, for any local cost or utility function over some finite alphabet), and for any \emph{constant} approximation ratio $α$, the task of finding an $α$-approximation of $Π$ in directed cycles has one of the following complexities:
  1. $O(1)$ rounds in deterministic LOCAL, $O(1)$ rounds in randomized LOCAL,
  2. $Θ(\log^* n)$ rounds in deterministic LOCAL, $O(1)$ rounds in randomized LOCAL,
  3. $Θ(\log^* n)$ rounds in deterministic LOCAL, $Θ(\log^* n)$ rounds in randomized LOCAL,
  4. $Θ(n)$ rounds in deterministic LOCAL, $Θ(n)$ rounds in randomized LOCAL.
  Moreover, for any given $Π$ and $α$, we can determine the complexity class automatically, with an efficient (centralized, sequential) meta-algorithm, and we can also efficiently synthesize an asymptotically optimal distributed algorithm.
  Before this work, similar results were only known for local search problems (e.g., locally checkable labeling problems). The family of local optimization problems is a strict generalization of local search problems, and it contains numerous commonly studied distributed tasks, such as the problems of finding approximations of the maximum independent set, minimum vertex cover, minimum dominating set, and minimum vertex coloring.

Abstract: The rapid growth of decentralized systems in theWeb3 ecosystem has introduced numerous challenges, particularly in ensuring data security, privacy, and scalability [3, 8]. These systems rely heavily on distributed architectures, requiring robust mechanisms to manage data and interactions among participants securely. One critical aspect of decentralized systems is key management, which is essential for encrypting files, securing database segments, and enabling private transactions. However, securely managing cryptographic keys in a distributed environment poses significant risks, especially when nodes in the network can be compromised [9]. This research proposes a decentralized database scheme specifically designed for secure and private key management. Our approach ensures that cryptographic keys are not stored explicitly at any location, preventing their discovery even if an attacker gains control of multiple nodes. Instead of traditional storage, keys are encoded and distributed using the BFLUT (Bloom Filter for Private Look-Up Tables) algorithm [7], which enables secure retrieval without direct exposure. The system leverages OrbitDB [4], IPFS [1], and IPNS [10] for decentralized data management, providing robust support for consistency, scalability, and simultaneous updates. By combining these technologies, our scheme enhances both security and privacy while maintaining high performance and reliability. Our findings demonstrate the system's capability to securely manage keys, prevent unauthorized access, and ensure privacy, making it a foundational solution for Web3 applications requiring decentralized security.

Abstract: Internet services and applications depend critically on the availability and acc uracy of network time. The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is one of the oldest core network protocols and remains the de facto mechanism for clock synchronization across the Internet today. While multiple NTP infrastructures exist, one, the "NTP Pool," presents an attractive attack target for two basic reasons, it is: 1) administratively distributed and based on volunteer servers; and 2) heavily utilized, including by IoT and infrastructure devices worldwide. We %develop measurements to gather the first direct, non-inferential, and comprehensive data on the NTP pool, including: longitudinal server and account membership, server configurations, time quality, aliases, and global query traffic load.
  We gather complete and granular data over a nine month period to discover over 15k servers (both active and inactive) and shed new light into the NTP Pool's use, dynamics, and robustness. By analyzing address aliases, accounts, and network connectivity, we find that only 19.7% of the pool's active servers are fully independent. Finally, we show that an adversary informed with our data can better and more precisely mount "monopoly attacks" to capture the preponderance of NTP pool traffic in 90% of all countries with only 10 or fewer malicious NTP servers. Our results suggest multiple avenues by which the robustness of the pool can be improved.

Abstract: Despite current security implementations, Internet activity on DoD networks is susceptible to web trackers and commercial data collection, which have the potential to expose information about service members and unit operations. This report documents the outcomes of a study to characterize web tracking occurring on Army CONUS unclassified networks. We derived a dataset from the Cloud-Based Internet Isolation (CBII) platform, encompassing data measured over a two-month period in 2024. This dataset comprised the 1,000 most frequently accessed Internet resources, determined by the number of connection requests on CONUS DoDIN-A during the study period. We then compared all domains and subdomains in the dataset against Ghostery's WhoTracks.me, an open-source database of commercial tracking entities. We found that over 21% of the domains accessed during the study period were Internet trackers. The ACI recommends that the Army implement changes to its enterprise networks to limit commercial Internet-based tracking, as well as policy changes towards the same end. With relatively minor configuration changes, CBII can serve as a more effective mitigation against risks posed by commercially available information.

Abstract: Military and disaster relief operations increasingly rely on unmanned vehicles (UxVs). It is important to develop a network control system (NCS) that can continuously coordinate and optimize the movement of UxVs based on mission objectives. However, prior research on NCS aims to always maintain a connected network topology, which limits the utility of the resulting systems. In this paper, we present an approach to systematically increase the topology flexibility for an NCS by leveraging the well-studied concept of disruption-tolerant networking (DTN). We design a DTN-compatible communication utility model that, while allowing some nodes to temporarily disconnect from others, provides for a fine-grain specification of the minimum communication frequency and the maximum hops permitted for message delivery between each pair of nodes. As such, the model supports what-if analyses before a mission to determine the best communication parameters to use for a given set of UxVs. Furthermore, we incorporate our communication model into an existing NCS and evaluate its performance in a simulated scenario involving the use of five UxVs searching for an enemy ship. The results show that our model not only enables the NCS to find the enemy ship faster but also facilitates new capabilities, such as dividing the UxVs into multiple teams responsible for different search areas.

Abstract: Rail-optimized network fabrics have become the de facto datacenter scale-out fabric for large-scale ML training. However, the use of high-radix electrical switches to provide all-to-all connectivity in rails imposes massive power and cost. We propose a rethinking of the rail abstraction by retaining its communication semantics, but realizing it using optical circuit switches. The key challenge is that optical switches support one-to-one connectivity at a time, limiting the fan-out of traffic in ML workloads using hybrid parallelisms. We overcome this through \emph{parallelism-driven rail reconfiguration}, which exploits the non-overlapping communication phases of different parallelism dimensions. This time-multiplexes a single set of physical ports across circuit configurations tailored to each phase within a training iteration. We design and implement Opus, a control plane that orchestrates this in-job reconfiguration of photonic rails at parallelism phase boundaries, and evaluate it on a physical OCS testbed, the Perlmutter supercomputer, and in simulation at up to 2,048 GPUs. Our results show that photonic rails can achieve over $23\times$ network power reduction and $4\times$ cost savings while incurring less than $6\%$ training overhead at production-relevant OCS reconfiguration latencies.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT) has brought remarkable advancements to industries by enabling interconnected systems and intelligent automation. However, this exponential growth has also introduced significant security vulnerabilities, making IoT networks increasingly targets for sophisticated cyberattacks. The heterogeneity of IoT devices poses critical challenges for traditional intrusion detection systems. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an innovative method called Adaptive Meta-Aggregation Federated Learning (AMAFed), designed to enhance intrusion detection in heterogeneous IoT networks. By employing a dynamic weighting mechanism using meta-learning, AMAFed assigns adaptive importance to local models based on their data quality and contributions, enabling personalized yet collaborative learning across devices. The proposed method was evaluated on three benchmark IoT datasets: ToN-IoT, N-BaIoT, and BoT-IoT, representing diverse real-world scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that AMAFed achieves detection accuracy up to 99.8% on ToN-IoT, with F1-scores exceeding 98% across all datasets. On the N-BaIoT dataset, it reaches 99.88% accuracy, and on BoT-IoT, it achieves 98.12% accuracy, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: The rise of heterogeneous Internet of Things (IoT) devices has raised security concerns due to their vulnerability to cyberattacks. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are crucial in addressing these threats. Federated Learning (FL) offers a privacy-preserving solution, but IoT heterogeneity and limited computational resources cause increased latency and reduced performance. This paper introduces a novel approach Cluster-based federated intrusion detection with lightweight networks for heterogeneous IoT designed to address these limitations. The proposed framework utilizes a hierarchical IoT architecture that encompasses edge, fog, and cloud layers. Intrusion detection clients operate at the fog layer, leveraging federated learning to enhance data privacy and distributed processing efficiency. To enhance efficiency, the method employs the lightweight MobileNet model alongside a hybrid loss function that integrates Gumbel-SoftMax and SoftMax, optimizing resource consumption while maintaining high detection accuracy. A key feature of this approach is clustering IoT devices based on hardware similarities, enabling more efficient model training and aggregation tailored to each cluster's computational capacity. This strategy not only simplifies the complexity of managing heterogeneous data and devices but also improves scalability and overall system performance. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, extensive experiments were conducted using the ToN-IoT and CICDDoS2019 datasets. Results demonstrate that the proposed approach reduces end-to-end training time by 2.47x compared to traditional FL methods, achieves 2.16x lower testing latency, and maintains exceptionally high detection accuracy of 99.22% and 99.02% on the ToN-IoT and CICDDoS2019 datasets, respectively.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of heterogeneous Internet of Things (IoT) environments has heightened security risks, as resource-constrained devices remain vulnerable to diverse cyberattacks. Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a privacy-preserving paradigm for collaborative intrusion detection; however, device and data heterogeneity introduce major challenges, including straggler delays, unstable convergence, and unbalanced error rates. This paper presents a Calibrated Federated Learning method with Hardware-aware Fuzzy Clustering (CF-HFC) to enhance intrusion detection performance in heterogeneous IoT networks. The proposed three-tier Edge-Fog-Cloud architecture integrates three complementary components: (1) hardware-aware fuzzy clustering, which organizes clients by computational capacity to mitigate straggler effects; (2) Fuzzy-FedProx aggregation, which stabilizes optimization under non-IID data distributions; and (3) Adaptive Conformal Calibration (ACC), which dynamically adjusts decision thresholds to balance false negative and false positive rates. Extensive experiments on ToN-IoT, BoT-IoT, Edge-IIoTset, and CICDDoS2019 datasets demonstrate that CF-HFC outperforms baseline methods such as FedAvg and FedProx, achieving over 99% detection accuracy, faster convergence, and lower communication latency. Overall, the results verify that CF-HFC effectively mitigates both device- and data-level heterogeneity, compared to existing federated learning approaches, providing accurate and efficient intrusion detection across Heterogeneous IoTs environment.

Abstract: AI Video Assistant emerges as a new paradigm for Real-time Communication (RTC), where one peer is a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) deployed in the cloud. This makes interaction between humans and AI more intuitive, akin to chatting with a real person. However, a fundamental mismatch exists between current RTC frameworks and AI Video Assistants, stemming from the drastic shift in Quality of Experience (QoE) and more challenging networks. Measurements on our production prototype also confirm that current RTC fails, causing latency spikes and accuracy drops.
  To address these challenges, we propose Artic, an AI-oriented RTC framework for MLLM Video Assistants, exploring the shift from "humans watching video" to "AI understanding video." Specifically, Artic proposes: (1) Response Capability-aware Adaptive Bitrate, which utilizes MLLM accuracy saturation to proactively cap bitrate, reserving bandwidth headroom to absorb future fluctuations for latency reduction; (2) Zero-overhead Context-aware Streaming, which allocates limited bitrate to regions most important for the response, maintaining accuracy even under ultra-low bitrates; and (3) Degraded Video Understanding Benchmark, the first benchmark evaluating how RTC-induced video degradation affects MLLM accuracy. Prototype experiments using real-world uplink traces show that compared with existing methods, Artic significantly improves accuracy by 15.12% and reduces latency by 135.31 ms. We will release the benchmark and codes at https://github.com/pku-netvideo/DeViBench.

Abstract: QUIC, as the transport layer of the next-generation Web stack (HTTP/3), natively provides security and performance improvements over TCP-based stacks. However, since QUIC provides end-to-end encryption for both data and packet headers, in-network assistance like Performance-Enhancing Proxy (PEP) is unavailable for QUIC. To achieve the similar optimization as TCP, some works seek to collaborate endpoints and middleboxes to provide in-network assistance for QUIC. But involving both host and in-network devices increases the difficulty of deployment in the Internet.
  In this paper, by analyzing the QUIC standard, implementations, and the locality of application traffic, we identify opportunities for transparent middleboxes to measure RTT and infer packet loss for QUIC connections, despite the absence of plaintext ACK information. We then propose PEMI as a concrete system that continuously measures RTT and infers lost packets, enabling fast retransmissions for QUIC. PEMI enables performance enhancement for QUIC in a completely transparent manner, without requiring any explicit cooperation from the endpoints. To keep fairness, PEMI employs a delay-based congestion control and utilizes feedback-based methods to enforce CWND. Extensive evaluation results, including Mininet and trace-driven dynamic experiments, show that PEMI can significantly improve the performance of QUIC. For example, in the Mininet experiments, PEMI increases the goodput of file transfers by up to 2.5$\times$, and reduces the 90th percentile jitter of RTC frames by 20-75%.

Abstract: Deploying expressive learning models directly on programmable dataplanes promises line-rate, low-latency traffic analysis but remains hindered by strict hardware constraints and the need for predictable, auditable behavior. Chimera introduces a principled framework that maps attention-oriented neural computations and symbolic constraints onto dataplane primitives, enabling trustworthy inference within the match-action pipeline. Chimera combines a kernelized, linearized attention approximation with a two-layer key-selection hierarchy and a cascade fusion mechanism that enforces hard symbolic guarantees while preserving neural expressivity. The design includes a hardware-aware mapping protocol and a two-timescale update scheme that together permit stable, line-rate operation under realistic dataplane budgets. The paper presents the Chimera architecture, a hardware mapping strategy, and empirical evidence showing that neuro-symbolic attention primitives can achieve high-fidelity inference within the resource envelope of commodity programmable switches.

Abstract: The transition to disaggregated and interoperable Open Radio Access Network (RAN) architectures and the introduction of RAN Intelligent Controllers (RICs) in O-RAN creates new resource optimization opportunities and fine-grained tuning and configuration of network components to save energy while fulfilling service demand. However, unlocking this potential requires fine-grained and accurate energy measurements across heterogeneous deployments. Three factors make this particularly challenging [...]. To address these challenges, we design the TENORAN framework, an automated measurement scaffold for fine-grained energy efficiency profiling of O-RAN deployments, and prototype it on a heterogeneous OpenShift cluster. TENORAN instruments an end-to-end deployment based on high-level specifications (e.g., gNB software stack and split options, traffic profiles), and collects synchronized performance metrics and power measurements for individual RAN components while the network is under controlled workloads including over-the-air traffic. Our experimental results demonstrate energy profiling of end-to-end experiments with xApps in the loop, energy efficiency differences between two RAN stacks, OpenAirInterface and srsRAN, in uplink and downlink, and core network power consumption trends.

Abstract: This study aims to ensure consistency in accuracy throughout the entire design flow in the implementation of edge AI hardware for few-shot learning, by implementing fixed-point data processing in the pre-training and evaluation phases. Specifically, the quantization module, called Brevitas, is applied to implement fixed-point data processing, which allows for arbitrary specification of the bit widths for the integer and fractional parts. Two methods of fixed-point data quantization, quantization-aware training (QAT) and post-training quantization (PTQ), are utilized in Brevitas. With Tensil, which is used in the current design flow, the bit widths of the integer and fractional parts need to be 8 bits each or 16 bits each when implemented in hardware, but performance validation has shown that accuracy comparable to floating-point operations can be maintained even with 6 bits or 5 bits each, indicating potential for further reduction in computational resources. These results clearly contribute to the creation of a versatile design and evaluation environment for edge AI hardware for few-shot learning.

Abstract: Cache replacement remains a challenging problem in CPU microarchitecture, often addressed using hand-crafted heuristics, limiting cache performance. Cache data analysis requires parsing millions of trace entries with manual filtering, making the process slow and non-interactive. To address this, we introduce CacheMind, a conversational tool that uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Large Language Models (LLMs) to enable semantic reasoning over cache traces. Architects can now ask natural language questions like, "Why is the memory access associated with PC X causing more evictions?", and receive trace-grounded, human-readable answers linked to program semantics for the first time. To evaluate CacheMind, we present CacheMindBench, the first verified benchmark suite for LLM-based reasoning for the cache replacement problem. Using the SIEVE retriever, CacheMind achieves 66.67% on 75 unseen trace-grounded questions and 84.80% on 25 unseen policy-specific reasoning tasks; with RANGER, it achieves 89.33% and 64.80% on the same evaluations. Additionally, with RANGER, CacheMind achieves 100% accuracy on 4 out of 6 categories in the trace-grounded tier of CacheMindBench. Compared to LlamaIndex (10% retrieval success), SIEVE achieves 60% and RANGER achieves 90%, demonstrating that existing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAGs) are insufficient for precise, trace-grounded microarchitectural reasoning. We provided four concrete actionable insights derived using CacheMind, wherein bypassing use case improved cache hit rate by 7.66% and speedup by 2.04%, software fix use case gives speedup of 76%, and Mockingjay replacement policy use case gives speedup of 0.7%; showing the utility of CacheMind on non-trivial queries that require a natural-language interface.

Abstract: The proliferation of Transformer models is often constrained by the significant computational and memory bandwidth demands of deployment. To address this, we present MXFormer, a novel, hybrid, weight-stationary Compute-in-Memory (CIM) accelerator that provides high throughput and efficiency for fixed-model inference on large short-sequence Transformers. Our architecture's foundation is the use of ultra-dense Charge-Trap Transistors (CTTs) in Microscaling MXFP4 CIM arrays, uniquely enabling the on-chip storage of up to hundreds of millions of parameters in Fully Weight Stationary (FWS) fashion.
  We introduce a statically partitioned design with 12 Transformer blocks connected by a deeply pipelined dataflow. Static-weight layers (MLPs and linear projections) execute on highly parallel analog CTT arrays using an MXFP4-native flow with per-block exponent alignment and a 10-bit SAR ADC. Dynamic computations are handled in fully accurate digital blocks that utilize MXFP-enabled systolic arrays for scaled dot-product attention and vector units for LayerNorm and FlashAttention-style Softmax.
  By eliminating all weight movement, the deeply pipelined MXFormer architecture yields very high single-stream throughput and efficiency, processing 58275 FPS on ViT-L/32 (dual-chip) or 41269 FPS on ViT-B/16 (single chip). MXFormer outperforms comparable state-of-the-art non-FWS digital, hybrid and photonic Transformer accelerators ~3.3x-60.5x in compute density and ~1.7x-2.5x in energy efficiency. Against FWS accelerators, MXFormer improves compute density by ~20.9x and resident weight storage density by ~2x, while preserving near-digital accuracy (drop of <1%) without any model retraining.

Abstract: Modern microservices increasingly depend on high-performance remote procedure calls (RPCs) to coordinate fine-grained, distributed computation. As network bandwidths continue to scale, the CPU overhead associated with RPC processing, particularly serialization, deserialization, and protocol handling, has become a critical bottleneck. This challenge is exacerbated by fast user-space networking stacks such as DPDK, which expose RPC processing as the dominant performance limiter. While prior work has explored software optimizations and FPGA-based offload engines, these approaches remain physically distant from the CPU's memory hierarchy, incurring unnecessary data movement and cache pollution. We present Arcalis, a near-cache RPC accelerator that positions a lightweight hardware engine adjacent to the last-level cache (LLC). Arcalis offloads RPC processing to dedicated microengines on receive and transmit paths that operate with cache-line latency while preserving programmability. By decoupling RPC processing logic, enabling microservice-specific execution, and positioning itself near the LLC to immediately consume data injected by network cards, Arcalis achieves 1.79-4.16$\times$ end-to-end speedup compared to the CPU baseline, while significantly reducing microarchitectural overhead by up to 88%, and achieves up to a 1.62$\times$ higher throughput than prior solutions. These results highlight the potential of near-cache RPC acceleration as a practical solution for high-performance microservice deployment.

Abstract: Heterogeneous embedded systems, with diverse computing elements and accelerators such as FPGAs, offer a promising platform for fast and flexible ML inference, which is crucial for services such as autonomous driving and augmented reality, where delays can be costly. However, efficiently allocating computational resources for deep learning applications in FPGA-based systems is a challenging task. A Deep Learning Processor Unit (DPU) is a parameterizable FPGA-based accelerator module optimized for ML inference. It supports a wide range of ML models and can be instantiated multiple times within a single FPGA to enable concurrent execution. This paper introduces DPUConfig, a novel runtime management framework, based on a custom Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent, that dynamically selects optimal DPU configurations by leveraging real-time telemetry data monitoring, system utilization, power consumption, and application performance to inform its configuration selection decisions. The experimental evaluation demonstrates that the RL agent achieves energy efficiency 95% (on average) of the optimal attainable energy efficiency for several CNN models on the Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC ZCU102.

Abstract: Recent studies have extensively explored NPU architectures for accelerating AI inference in on-device environments, which are inherently resource-constrained. Meanwhile, transformer-based large language models (LLMs) have become dominant, with rapidly increasing model sizes but low degree of parameter reuse compared to conventional CNNs, making end-to-end execution on resource-limited devices extremely challenging. To address these challenges, we propose TriGen, a novel NPU architecture tailored for resource-constrained environments through software-hardware co-design. Firstly, TriGen adopts low-precision computation using microscaling (MX) to enable additional optimization opportunities while preserving accuracy, and resolves the issues that arise by employing such precision. Secondly, to jointly optimize both nonlinear and linear operations, TriGen eliminates the need for specialized hardware for essential nonlinear operations by using fast and accurate LUT, thereby maximizing performance gains and reducing hardware-cost in on-device environments, and finally, by taking practical hardware constraints into account, further employs scheduling techniques to maximize computational utilization even under limited on-chip memory capacity. We evaluate the performance of TriGen on various LLMs and show that TriGen achieves an average 2.73x performance speedup and 52% less memory transfer over the baseline NPU design with negligible accuracy loss.
