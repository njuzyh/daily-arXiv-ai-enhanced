Abstract: Processing in Memory (PIM) and similar terms such as Compute In Memory (CIM), Logic in Memory (LIM), In Memory Computing (IMC), and Near Memory Computing (NMC) have gained attention recently as a potentially ``revolutionary new'' technique. The truth, however, is that many examples of the technology go back over 60 years. This document attempts to provide an annotated bibliography of PIM technology that attempts to cover the whole time-frame, and is organized to augment a forth-coming article.

Abstract: Efficient load-balancing mechanisms are critical for maximizing performance and increasing the quality of service (QoS) of data center networks (DCNs). Obtaining the optimal QoS while minimizing resource consumption remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes the streamlined pathway (SP) model, which is a flow scheduling solution that requires minimal statistical knowledge of the DCN data plane. The SP model utilizes the software-defined networks (SDN) paradigm with less information gathered from the DCN data plane, besides the traditional hash-based flow scheduling mechanism, the Equal Cost Multi-Path (ECMP). In SDN, the proposed methodology harnesses a minimal yet powerful set of statistical data extracted from the DCN data plane, including port throughput and elephant flow information on the aggregate switches of the DCN fat-tree topology. Several experiments, in addition to theoretical analysis, have been conducted to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed SP model in terms of QoS enhancement. These results confirm that SP outperforms leading techniques such as Sieve, Hedera, and ECMP, concerning bisection bandwidth, DCN link utilization, packet loss, and packet delivery latency.

Abstract: This paper presents an innovative framework that boosts computing power by utilizing ubiquitous computing power distribution and enabling higher computing node accessibility via adaptive UAV positioning, establishing a UAV-enabled Computing Power Network (UAV-CPN). In a UAV-CPN, a UAV functions as a dynamic relay, outsourcing computing tasks from the request zone to an expanded service zone with diverse computing nodes, including vehicle onboard units, edge servers, and dedicated powerful nodes. This approach has the potential to alleviate communication bottlenecks and overcome the "island effect" observed in multi-access edge computing. A significant challenge is to quantify computing power performance under complex dynamics of communication and computing. To address this challenge, we introduce task completion probability to capture the capability of UAV-CPNs for task computing. We further enhance UAV-CPN performance under a hybrid energy architecture by jointly optimizing UAV altitude and transmit power, where fuel cells and batteries collectively power both UAV propulsion and communication systems. Extensive evaluations show significant performance gains, highlighting the importance of balancing communication and computing capabilities, especially under dual-energy constraints. These findings underscore the potential of UAV-CPNs to significantly boost computing power.

Abstract: Dynamic spectrum sharing (DSS) among multi-operator low Earth orbit (LEO) mega-constellations is essential for coexistence, yet prevailing policies focus almost exclusively on interference mitigation, leaving geographic equity largely unaddressed. This work investigates whether conventional DSS approaches inadvertently exacerbate the rural digital divide. Through large-scale, 3GPP-compliant non-terrestrial network (NTN) simulations with geographically distributed users, we systematically evaluate standard allocation policies. The results uncover a stark and persistent structural bias: SNR-priority scheduling induces a 1.65x urban-rural access disparity, privileging users with favorable satellite geometry. Counter-intuitively, increasing system bandwidth amplifies rather than alleviates this gap, with disparity rising from 1.0x to 1.65x as resources expand. To remedy this, we propose FairShare, a lightweight, quota-based framework that enforces geographic fairness. FairShare not only reverses the bias, achieving an affirmative disparity ratio of Delta_geo = 0.72x, but also reduces scheduler runtime by 3.3%. This demonstrates that algorithmic fairness can be achieved without trading off efficiency or complexity. Our work provides regulators with both a diagnostic metric for auditing fairness and a practical, enforceable mechanism for equitable spectrum governance in next-generation satellite networks.

Abstract: The GEneral Matrix Multiplication (GEMM) is one of the essential algorithms in scientific computing. Single-thread GEMM implementations are well-optimised with techniques like blocking and autotuning. However, due to the complexity of modern multi-core shared memory systems, it is challenging to determine the number of threads that minimises the multi-thread GEMM runtime. We present a proof-of-concept approach to building an Architecture and Data-Structure Aware Linear Algebra (ADSALA) software library that uses machine learning to optimise the runtime performance of BLAS routines. More specifically, our method uses a machine learning model on-the-fly to automatically select the optimal number of threads for a given GEMM task based on the collected training data. Test results on two different HPC node architectures, one based on a two-socket Intel Cascade Lake and the other on a two-socket AMD Zen 3, revealed a 25 to 40 per cent speedup compared to traditional GEMM implementations in BLAS when using GEMM of memory usage within 100 MB.

Abstract: We present a transaction-driven dynamic reconfiguration protocol in Modern payment systems based on Byzantine Consistent Broadcast which can achieve high performance by avoiding global transaction ordering. We demonstrate the fundamental paradigm of modern payment systems, which combines user nonce based transactions ordering with periodic system-wide consensus mechanisms. Building on this foundation, we design PDCC(Payment Dynamic Config Change), which can lead a smooth reconfiguration process without impacting the original system's performance.

Abstract: The parallel Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) protocol is viewed as a promising solution to address the consensus scalability issue of the permissioned blockchain. One of the main challenges in parallel BFT is the view change process that happens when the leader node fails, which can lead to performance bottlenecks. Existing parallel BFT protocols typically rely on passive view change mechanisms with blind leader rotation. Such approaches frequently select unavailable or slow nodes as leaders, resulting in degraded performance. To address these challenges, we propose a View Change Optimization (VCO) model based on mixed integer programming that optimizes leader selection and follower reassignment across parallel committees by considering communication delays and failure scenarios. We applied a decomposition method with efficient subproblems and improved benders cuts to solve the VCO model. Leveraging the results of improved decomposition solution method, we propose an efficient iterative backup leader selection algorithm as views proceed. By performing experiments in Microsoft Azure cloud environments, we demonstrate that the VCO-driven parallel BFT outperforms existing configuration methods under both normal operation and faulty condition. The results show that the VCO model is effective as network size increases, making it a suitable solution for high-performance parallel BFT systems.

Abstract: LLM inference latency critically determines user experience and operational costs, directly impacting throughput under SLO constraints. Even brief latency spikes degrade service quality despite acceptable average performance. However, distributed inference environments featuring diverse software frameworks and XPU architectures combined with dynamic workloads make latency analysis challenging. Constrained by intrusive designs that necessitate service restarts or even suspension, and by hardware-bound implementations that fail to adapt to heterogeneous inference environments, existing AI profiling methods are often inadequate for real-time production analysis.
  We present LatencyPrism, the first zero-intrusion multi-platform latency sculpting system. It aims to break down the inference latency across pipeline, proactively alert on inference latency anomalies, and guarantee adherence to SLOs, all without requiring code modifications or service restarts. LatencyPrism has been deployed across thousands of XPUs for over six months. It enables low-overhead real-time monitoring at batch level with alerts triggered in milliseconds. This approach distinguishes between workload-driven latency variations and anomalies indicating underlying issues with an F1-score of 0.98. We also conduct extensive experiments and investigations into root cause analysis to demonstrate LatencyPrism's capability.

Abstract: The widespread deployment of large-scale, compute-intensive applications such as high-performance computing, artificial intelligence, and big data is leading to convergence between cloud and high-performance computing infrastructures. Cloud providers are increasingly integrating high-performance computing capabilities in their infrastructures, such as hardware accelerators and high-speed interconnects, while researchers in the high-performance computing community are starting to explore cloud-native paradigms to improve scalability, elasticity, and resource utilization. In this context, serverless computing emerges as a promising execution model to efficiently handle highly dynamic, parallel, and distributed workloads. This paper presents a comprehensive systematic literature review of 122 research articles published between 2018 and early 2025, exploring the use of the serverless paradigm to develop, deploy, and orchestrate compute-intensive applications across cloud, high-performance computing, and hybrid environments. From these, a taxonomy comprising eight primary research directions and nine targeted use case domains is proposed, alongside an analysis of recent publication trends and collaboration networks among authors, highlighting the growing interest and interconnections within this emerging research field. Overall, this work aims to offer a valuable foundation for both new researchers and experienced practitioners, guiding the development of next-generation serverless solutions for parallel compute-intensive applications.
