Gain Cell RAM (GCRAM) offers higher density, lower power, and tunable retention, expanding the design space beyond conventional SRAM. To this end, we create an OpenGCRAM compiler supporting both SRAM and GCRAM. It generates macro-level designs and layouts for commercial CMOS processes and characterizes area, delay, and power across user-defined configurations. The tool enables systematic identification of optimal heterogeneous memory configurations for AI tasks under specified performance metrics."}

This validity condition is motivated by practical aggregation tasks (e.g., robust learning or sensor fusion) where honest inputs need not coincide but should still constrain the decision. CA inherits BA lower bounds, and optimal synchronous round complexity is easy to obtain (e.g., via Byzantine Broadcast). The main challenge is \\emph{communication}: standard approaches for CA have a communication complexity of $Θ(Ln^2)$ for large $L$-bit inputs, leaving a gap in contrast to BA's lower bound of $Ω(Ln)$ bits. While recent work achieves optimal communication complexity of $O(Ln)$ for sufficiently large $L$ [GLW,PODC'25], translating this result to general convexity spaces remained an open problem.\n  We investigate this gap for abstract convexity spaces, and we present deterministic synchronous CA protocols with near-optimal communication complexity: when $L = Ω(n \\cdot κ)$, where $κ$ is a security parameter, we achieve $O(L\\cdot n\\log n)$ communication for finite convexity spaces and $O(L\\cdot n^{1+o(1)})$ communication for Euclidean spaces $\\mathbb{R}^d$. Our protocols have asymptotically optimal round complexity $O(n)$ and, when a bound on the inputs' lengths $L$ is fixed a priori, we achieve near-optimal resilience $t < n/(ω+\\varepsilon)$ for any constant $\\varepsilon>0$, where $ω$ is the Helly number of the convexity space. If $L$ is unknown, we still achieve resilience $t<n/(ω+\\varepsilon+1)$ for any constant $\\varepsilon > 0$. We further note that our protocols can be leveraged to efficiently solve parallel BA.\n  Our main technical contribution is the use of extractor graphs to obtain a deterministic assignment of parties to committees, which is resilient against adaptive adversaries."}

This work presents UnlinkableDFL, a DFL framework that combines a peer-based mixnet with fragment-based model aggregation to ensure unlinkability in fully decentralized settings. Model updates are divided into encrypted fragments, sent over separate multi-hop paths, and aggregated without using any identity information. A theoretical analysis indicates that relay and end-to-end unlinkability improve with larger mixing sets and longer paths, while convergence remains similar to standard FedAvg. A prototype implementation evaluates learning performance, latency, unlinkability, and resource usage. The results show that UnlinkableDFL converges reliably and adapts to node churn. Communication latency emerges as the main overhead, while memory and CPU usage stay moderate. These findings illustrate the balance between anonymity and system efficiency, demonstrating that strong unlinkability can be maintained in decentralized learning workflows."}

In prevalent disaggregated architectures, loading the massive KV-Cache from external storage creates a fundamental imbalance: storage NICs on prefill engines become bandwidth-saturated, while those on decoding engines remain idle. This asymmetry severely constrains overall system throughput.\n  We present DualPath, an inference system that breaks this bottleneck by introducing dual-path KV-Cache loading. Beyond the traditional storage-to-prefill path, DualPath enables a novel storage-to-decode path, in which the KV-Cache is loaded into decoding engines and then efficiently transferred to prefill engines via RDMA over the compute network. DualPath combines this optimized data path -- which inherently avoids network congestion and avoids interference with latency-critical model execution communications -- with a global scheduler that dynamically balances load across prefill and decode engines.\n  Our evaluation on three models with production agentic workloads demonstrates that DualPath improves offline inference throughput by up to 1.87$\\times$ on our in-house inference system. It can also improve online serving throughput by an average factor of 1.96$\\times$ without violating SLO."}

In this paper, we investigate 6G networks integrated with TSN and how to compensate for wireless stochastic behavior which involves a large intrinsic packet delay variation. We evaluate a 6G solution to reduce packet delay variation that is based on de-jittering. For this, we propose to use virtual timeslots for providing the required time-awareness. We discuss the benefits of the proposed solution while evaluating the impact of the timeslot size on the number of schedulable TSN streams."}

Toosi"], "title": "Multi-Layer Scheduling for MoE-Based LLM Reasoning", "comment": "12 pages, 10 figures", "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across a wide range of tasks, but serving them efficiently at scale remains a critical challenge due to their substantial computational and latency demands. While most existing inference frameworks rely on simple scheduling strategies such as First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS) at the engine level and Round-Robin (RR) at the scheduler or coordinator level, they often fail to fully utilize system resources and may suffer from issues such as head-of-line blocking and load imbalance. Recent advances in Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have also introduced new challenges in scheduling arising from expert parallelism and routing complexity. This research proposes a multi-layer scheduling framework tailored for MoE-based LLM serving. It targets scheduling at three levels: request-level, enginelevel, and expert-level. At the request level, we explore algorithms such as Shortest-Job-First (SJF) and priority-aware aging to improve throughput and reduce latency. At the engine level, we design load-aware dispatching strategies that account for the current prefix token load, KV cache utilization, and user stickiness to achieve better resource matching. At the expert level, we focus on alleviating expert hotspots and strategically placing inter-layer expert dependencies to balance load and improve routing efficiency. Extensive experimental results from more than 100 experiments conducted under diverse workload distributions show that our approach consistently outperforms the state-of-theart inference framework vLLM, achieving up to 17.8% reduction in Time To First Token (TTFT) latency and 13.3% reduction in Time-Per-Output-Token (TPOT) latency."}

Although features are more compact than raw packet traces, their storage has become a scalability bottleneck from large-scale core networks to resource-constrained Internet of Things (IoT) environments. This article investigates task-aware lossy compression strategies that reduce the storage footprint of traffic features while preserving analytics accuracy. Using website classification in core networks and device identification in IoT environments as representative use cases, we show that simple, semantics-preserving compression techniques expose stable operating regions that balance storage efficiency and task performance. These results highlight compression as a first-class design dimension in scalable network monitoring systems."}

This is widely understood as a move away from Newtonian absolute time. We argue that Lamport's formalism retains a deeper and largely unexamined assumption: that causality induces a globally well-defined directed acyclic graph (DAG) over events -- a forward-in-time-only (FITO) structure that functions as an arrow of time embedded at the semantic level. Following Ryle's analysis of category mistakes, we show that this assumption conflates an epistemic construct (the logical ordering of messages) with an ontic claim (that physical causality is globally acyclic and monotonic). We trace this conflation through Shannon's channel model, TLA+, Bell's theorem, and the impossibility results of Fischer-Lynch-Paterson and Brewer's CAP theorem. We then show that special and general relativity permit only local causal structure, and that recent work on indefinite causal order demonstrates that nature admits correlations with no well-defined causal ordering. We propose that mutual information conservation, rather than temporal precedence, provides a more fundamental primitive for distributed consistency."}

However, real-world multimodal datasets are extremely heterogeneous. Existing training frameworks predominantly rely on static parallelism strategies, which suffer from severe load imbalance, redundant communication, and suboptimal hardware utilization under data heterogeneity. In this work, we propose Dynamic Hybrid Parallelism (DHP), an efficient parallelism strategy that adaptively reconfigures communication groups and parallelism degrees during MLLM training. We generalize the non-power-of-two parallelism degrees and develop a polynomial-time algorithm to generate near-optimal parallelism strategies with only millisecond-level overhead per training batch. DHP is able to maintain high hardware efficiency even under extreme data variability. Experimental results demonstrate that DHP significantly outperforms Megatron-LM and DeepSpeed, achieving up to 1.36 $\\times$ speedup in training throughput while maintaining near-linear scaling efficiency across large-scale NPU clusters."}
