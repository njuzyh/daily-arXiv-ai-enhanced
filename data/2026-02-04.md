Abstract: Electromigration (EM) induced stress evolution is a major reliability challenge in nanometer-scale VLSI interconnects. Accurate EM analysis requires solving stress-governing partial differential equations over large interconnect trees, which is computationally expensive using conventional finite-difference methods. This work proposes two fast EM stress analysis techniques based on rational Krylov subspace reduction. Unlike traditional Krylov methods that expand around zero frequency, rational Krylov methods enable expansion at selected time constants, aligning directly with metrics such as nucleation and steady-state times and producing compact reduced models with minimal accuracy loss. Two complementary frameworks are developed: a frequency-domain extended rational Krylov method, ExtRaKrylovEM, and a time-domain rational Krylov exponential integration method, EiRaKrylovEM. We show that the accuracy of both methods depends strongly on the choice of expansion point, or shift time, and demonstrate that effective shift times are typically close to times of interest such as nucleation or post-void steady state. Based on this observation, a coordinate descent optimization strategy is introduced to automatically determine optimal reduction orders and shift times for both nucleation and post-void phases. Experimental results on synthesized structures and industry-scale power grids show that the proposed methods achieve orders-of-magnitude improvements in efficiency and accuracy over finite-difference solutions. Using only 4 to 6 Krylov orders, the methods achieve sub-0.1 percent error in nucleation time and resistance change predictions while delivering 20 to 500 times speedup. In contrast, standard extended Krylov methods require more than 50 orders and still incur 10 to 20 percent nucleation time error, limiting their practicality for EM-aware optimization and stochastic EM analysis.

Abstract: The integration of distributed energy resources has ushered in a host of complex challenges, significantly impacting power quality in distribution networks. This work studies these challenges, exploring issues such as voltage fluctuations and escalating power losses caused by the integration of solar systems and electric vehicle (EV) chargers. We present a robust methodology focused on mitigating voltage deviations and power losses, emphasizing the allocation of a Permitted Percentage (PP) of battery-based solar systems within residential areas endowed with storage capabilities. A key facet of this research lies in its adaptability to the changing landscape of electric transportation. With the rapid increase of electric trucks on the horizon, our proposed model gains relevance. By tactically deploying PP to oversee the charging and discharging of batteries within residential solar systems, utilities are poised not only to assist with grid resilience but also to cater to the upcoming demands spurred by the advent of new EVs, notably trucks. To validate the efficacy of our proposed model, rigorous simulations were conducted using the IEEE 33-bus distribution network as a designed testbed. Leveraging advanced Particle Swarm Optimization techniques, we have deciphered the optimal charging and discharging commands issued by utilities to energy storage systems. The outcomes of these simulations help us understand the transformative potential of various PP allocations, shedding light on the balance between non-battery-based and battery-based solar residences. This research underscores the need for carefully crafted approaches in navigating the complexities of modern grid dynamics amid the anticipated increase in electric vehicles.

Abstract: Graph neural network (GNN) inference faces significant bottlenecks in preprocessing, which often dominate overall inference latency. We introduce AutoGNN, an FPGA-based accelerator designed to address these challenges by leveraging FPGA's reconfigurability and specialized components. AutoGNN adapts to diverse graph inputs, efficiently performing computationally intensive tasks such as graph conversion and sampling. By utilizing components like adder trees, AutoGNN executes reduction operations in constant time, overcoming the limitations of serialization and synchronization on GPUs.
  AutoGNN integrates unified processing elements (UPEs) and single-cycle reducers (SCRs) to streamline GNN preprocessing. UPEs enable scalable parallel processing for edge sorting and unique vertex selection, while SCRs efficiently handle sequential tasks such as pointer array construction and subgraph reindexing. A user-level software framework dynamically profiles graph inputs, determines optimal configurations, and reprograms AutoGNN to handle varying workloads. Implemented on a 7$n$m enterprise FPGA, AutoGNN achieves up to 9.0$\times$ and 2.1$\times$ speedup compared to conventional and GPU-accelerated preprocessing systems, respectively, enabling high-performance GNN preprocessing across diverse datasets.

Abstract: General matrix multiplication (GEMM) is a fundamental operation in deep learning (DL). With DL moving increasingly toward low precision, recent works have proposed novel unary GEMM designs as an alternative to conventional binary GEMM hardware. A rigorous evaluation of recent unary and binary GEMM designs is needed to assess the potential of unary hardware for future DL compute. This paper focuses on unary GEMM designs for integer-based DL inference and performs a detailed evaluation of three latest unary design proposals, namely, uGEMM, tuGEMM and tubGEMM, by comparing them to a conventional binary GEMM. Rigorous post-synthesis evaluations beyond prior works are performed across varying bit-widths and matrix sizes to assess the designs' tradeoffs and determine optimal sweetspots. Further, we perform weight sparsity analysis across eight pretrained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and the LLaMA2 large language model (LLM). In this work, we demonstrate how unary GEMM can be effectively used for energy-efficient compute in future edge AI accelerators.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have produced highly accurate but increasingly large and complex DNNs, making traditional fault-injection techniques impractical. Accurate fault analysis requires RTL-accurate hardware models. However, this significantly slows evaluation compared with software-only approaches, particularly when combined with expensive HDL instrumentation. In this work, we show that such high-overhead methods are unnecessary for systolic array (SA) architectures and propose ENFOR-SA, an end-to-end framework for DNN transient fault analysis on SAs. Our two-step approach employs cross-layer simulation and uses RTL SA components only during fault injection, with the rest executed at the software level. Experiments on CNNs and Vision Transformers demonstrate that ENFOR-SA achieves RTL-accurate fault injection with only 6% average slowdown compared to software-based injection, while delivering at least two orders of magnitude speedup (average $569\times$) over full-SoC RTL simulation and a $2.03\times$ improvement over a state-of-the-art cross-layer RTL injection tool. ENFOR-SA code is publicly available at https://github.com/rafaabt/ENFOR-SA.

Abstract: Leading experts from both communities have suggested the need to (re)connect research in neuroscience and artificial intelligence (AI) to accelerate the development of next-generation AI innovations. They term this convergence as NeuroAI. Previous research has established temporal neural networks (TNNs) as a promising neuromorphic approach toward biological intelligence and efficiency. We fully embrace NeuroAI and propose a new category of TNNs we call NeuroAI TNNs (NeuTNNs) with greater capability and hardware efficiency by adopting neuroscience findings, including a neuron model with active dendrites and a hierarchy of distal and proximal segments. This work introduces a PyTorch-to-layout tool suite (NeuTNNGen) to design application-specific NeuTNNs. Compared to previous TNN designs, NeuTNNs achieve superior performance and efficiency. We demonstrate NeuTNNGen's capabilities using three example applications: 1) UCR time series benchmarks, 2) MNIST design exploration, and 3) Place Cells design for neocortical reference frames. We also explore using synaptic pruning to further reduce synapse counts and hardware costs by 30-50% while maintaining model precision across diverse sensory modalities. NeuTNNGen can facilitate the design of application-specific energy-efficient NeuTNNs for the next generation of NeuroAI computing systems.

Abstract: Expanding Deep Learning applications toward edge computing demands architectures capable of delivering high computational performance and efficiency while adhering to tight power and memory constraints. Digital In-Memory Computing (DIMC) addresses this need by moving part of the computation directly within memory arrays, significantly reducing data movement and improving energy efficiency. This paper introduces a novel architecture that extends the Vector RISC-V Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) to integrate a tightly coupled DIMC unit directly into the execution stage of the pipeline, to accelerate Deep Learning inference at the edge. Specifically, the proposed approach adds four custom instructions dedicated to data loading, computation, and write-back, enabling flexible and optimal control of the inference execution on the target architecture. Experimental results demonstrate high utilization of the DIMC tile in Vector RISC-V and sustained throughput across the ResNet-50 model, achieving a peak performance of 137 GOP/s. The proposed architecture achieves a speedup of 217x over the baseline core and 50x area-normalized speedup even when operating near the hardware resource limits. The experimental results confirm the high potential of the proposed architecture as a scalable and efficient solution to accelerate Deep Learning inference on the edge.

Abstract: Domain-specialized FPGAs have delivered unprecedented performance for low-latency inference across scientific and industrial workloads, yet nearly all existing accelerators assume static models trained offline, relegating learning and adaptation to slower CPUs or GPUs. This separation fundamentally limits systems that must operate in non-stationary, high-frequency environments, where model updates must occur at the timescale of the underlying physics. In this paper, I argue for a shift from inference-only accelerators to ultrafast on-chip learning, in which both inference and training execute directly within the FPGA fabric under deterministic, sub-microsecond latency constraints. Bringing learning into the same real-time datapath as inference would enable closed-loop systems that adapt as fast as the physical processes they control, with applications spanning quantum error correction, cryogenic qubit calibration, plasma and fusion control, accelerator tuning, and autonomous scientific experiments. Enabling such regimes requires rethinking algorithms, architectures, and toolflows jointly, but promises to transform FPGAs from static inference engines into real-time learning machines.

Abstract: Ultrafast online learning is essential for high-frequency systems, such as controls for quantum computing and nuclear fusion, where adaptation must occur on sub-microsecond timescales. Meeting these requirements demands low-latency, fixed-precision computation under strict memory constraints, a regime in which conventional Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) are both inefficient and numerically unstable. We identify key properties of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) that align with these constraints. Specifically, we show that: (i) KAN updates exploiting B-spline locality are sparse, enabling superior on-chip resource scaling, and (ii) KANs are inherently robust to fixed-point quantization. By implementing fixed-point online training on Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), a representative platform for on-chip computation, we demonstrate that KAN-based online learners are significantly more efficient and expressive than MLPs across a range of low-latency and resource-constrained tasks. To our knowledge, this work is the first to demonstrate model-free online learning at sub-microsecond latencies.

Abstract: Fault injectors are essential tools for evaluating the reliability and resilience of computing systems. They enable the simulation of hardware and software faults to analyze system behavior under error conditions and assess its ability to operate correctly despite disruptions. Such analysis is critical for identifying vulnerabilities and improving system robustness. CHAOS is a modular, open-source, and fully configurable fault injection framework designed for the gem5 simulator. It facilitates precise and systematic fault injection across multiple architectural levels, supporting comprehensive evaluations of fault tolerance mechanisms and resilience strategies. Its high configurability and seamless integration with gem5 allow researchers to explore a wide range of fault models and complex scenarios, making CHAOS a valuable tool for advancing research in dependable and high-performance computing systems.

Abstract: Networks in the current 5G and beyond systems increasingly carry heterogeneous traffic with diverse quality-of-service constraints, making real-time routing decisions both complex and time-critical. A common approach, such as a heuristic with human intervention or training a single centralized RL policy or synchronizing updates across multiple learners, struggles with scalability and straggler effects. We address this by proposing an asynchronous multi-agent reinforcement learning (AMARL) framework in which independent PPO agents, one per service, plan routes in parallel and commit resource deltas to a shared global resource environment. This coordination by state preserves feasibility across services and enables specialization for service-specific objectives. We evaluate the method on an O-RAN like network simulation using nearly real-time traffic data from the city of Montreal. We compared against a single-agent PPO baseline. AMARL achieves a similar Grade of Service (acceptance rate) (GoS) and end-to-end latency, with reduced training wall-clock time and improved robustness to demand shifts. These results suggest that asynchronous, service-specialized agents provide a scalable and practical approach to distributed routing, with applicability extending beyond the O-RAN domain.

Abstract: As wireless communication networks grow in scale and complexity, diverse resource allocation tasks become increasingly critical. Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) provides a promising solution for distributed control, yet it often requires costly real-world interactions and lacks generalization across diverse tasks. Meanwhile, recent advances in Diffusion Models (DMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in modeling complex dynamics and supporting high-fidelity simulation. Motivated by these challenges and opportunities, we propose a Communication-based Diffusion World Model (NetWorld) to enable few-shot generalization across heterogeneous MARL tasks in wireless networks. To improve applicability to large-scale distributed networks, NetWorld adopts the Distributed Training with Decentralized Execution (DTDE) paradigm and is organized into a two-stage framework: (i) pre-training a classifier-guided conditional diffusion world model on multi-task offline datasets, and (ii) performing trajectory planning entirely within this world model to avoid additional online interaction. Cross-task heterogeneity is handled via shared latent processing for observations, two-hot discretization for task-specific actions and rewards, and an inverse dynamics model for action recovery. We further introduce a lightweight Mean Field (MF) communication mechanism to reduce non-stationarity and promote coordinated behaviors with low overhead. Experiments on three representative tasks demonstrate improved performance and sample efficiency over MARL baselines, indicating strong scalability and practical potential for wireless network optimization.

Abstract: The Internet has evolved through successive architectural abstractions that enabled unprecedented scale, interoperability, and innovation. Packet-based networking enabled the reliable transport of bits; cloud-native systems enabled the orchestration of distributed computation. Today, the emergence of autonomous, learning-based systems introduces a new architectural challenge: intelligence is increasingly embedded directly into network control, computation, and decision-making, yet the Internet lacks a structural foundation for representing and exchanging meaning. In this paper, we argue that cognition alone: pattern recognition, prediction, and optimization, is insufficient for the next generation of networked systems. As autonomous agents act across safety-critical and socio-technical domains, systems must not only compute and communicate, but also comprehend intent, context, and consequence. We introduce the concept of a Semantic Layer: a new architectural stratum that treats meaning as a first-class construct, enabling interpretive alignment, semantic accountability, and intelligible autonomous behavior. We show that this evolution leads naturally to a Syntactic-Semantic Internet. The syntactic stack continues to transport bits, packets, and workloads with speed and reliability, while a parallel semantic stack transports meaning, grounding, and consequence. We describe the structure of this semantic stack-semantic communication, a semantic substrate, and an emerging Agentic Web, and draw explicit architectural parallels to TCP/IP and the World Wide Web. Finally, we examine current industry efforts, identify critical architectural gaps, and outline the engineering challenges required to make semantic interoperability a global, interoperable infrastructure.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of modern wide-area networks (WANs) has made traffic engineering (TE) increasingly challenging, as traditional solvers struggle to keep pace. Although existing offline ML-driven approaches accelerate TE optimization with deep neural networks (DNNs), they often lack sufficient expressiveness and generalization on unseen traffic patterns or topologies, limiting their practicality. Inspired by the success of large language models (LMs), for the first time, this paper investigates their potential as general-purpose traffic planners. Our contributions are two-fold: (i) Theoretically, we show that pre-trained LMs can simulate the sequential decision processes underlying TE and, crucially, exhibit parallel reasoning capabilities, making them well-suited for the task; (ii) Practically, we present LMTE, a novel LM-driven TE framework that embraces these insights through efficient multimodal alignment and lightweight configuration generation, all while preserving the model's original abilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that fold matches top-tier performance on five datasets, achieving up to 15\% better maximum link utilization (MLU) and consistently lower performance degradation across diverse scenarios, e.g., less than 5\% with high traffic dynamics and link failures. Moreover, it achieves 10 to 100 times speedups over traditional TE solvers. To aid future works, our codebase is available at https://github.com/Y-debug-sys/LMTE.

Abstract: Ensuring network resilience in 6G and beyond is essential to maintain service continuity during base station (BS) outages due to failures, disasters, attacks, or energy-saving operations. This paper proposes a novel resilience optimization framework for integrated satellite-terrestrial networks (ISTNs), leveraging low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites to assist users when terrestrial BSs are unavailable. Specifically, we develop a realistic multi-cell model incorporating user association, antenna downtilt adaptation, power control, heterogeneous traffic demands, and dynamic user distribution. The objective is to maximize of the total user rate in the considered area by optimizing the BS's antenna tilt, transmission power, user association to neighboring BS or to a LEO satellite with a minimum number of successfully served user satisfaction constraint, defined by rate and Reference Signal Received Power (RSRP) requirements. To solve the non-convex, NP-hard problem, we design a deep Q-network (DQN)-based algorithm to learn network dynamics to maximize throughput while minimizing LEO satellite usage, thereby limiting reliance on links with longer propagation delays and prolonging satellite operational lifetime. Simulation results confirm that our approach significantly outperforms the benchmark one.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of multimedia applications in smart city environments and the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) presents significant challenges for existing network infrastructures, particularly with the advent of 5G and emerging 6G technologies. Traditional architectures struggle to meet the demands for scalability, adaptability, and energy efficiency required by data-intensive multimedia services. To address these challenges, this study proposes an innovative, energy-efficient framework for multimedia resource management in software-defined 5G/6G IoV networks, leveraging a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller. The framework integrates Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) technologies to enable centralized and adaptive control over network resources. By employing a PID controller, it dynamically manages load distribution and temperature, ensuring balanced resource allocation and minimizing energy waste. Comprehensive simulations validate the framework's effectiveness, demonstrating significant improvements in load balancing, CPU utilization, and energy consumption compared to traditional methods. For instance, under heavy traffic conditions, the proposed framework maintained resource efficiency, reducing power consumption by up to 30% and achieving nearly equal load distribution across all network components. Additionally, the controller exhibited exceptional scalability, effectively responding to over 98% of vehicle requests even in scenarios of extreme traffic demand.

Abstract: Accurate and energy efficient localization remains a key challenge in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), particularly when obstacles affect signal propagation. This study introduces AOASS (Adaptive Obstacle Aware Square Spiral), a new single mobile anchor framework that combines an optimized square spiral movement pattern with adaptive obstacle detection. The mobile anchor can sense and bypass obstacles while maintaining high localization accuracy and full network coverage, ensuring that each node receives at least three noncollinear beacon signals for reliable position estimation. Localization accuracy is further improved using the OLSTM DV Hop model, which integrates a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network with the traditional DV Hop algorithm to estimate hop distances better and reduce multi hop errors. The anchor trajectory is managed by a TD3 LSTM reinforcement learning agent, supported by a Kalman based prediction layer and a fuzzy logic ORCA safety module for smooth and collision free navigation. Simulation experiments across different obstacle densities show that AOASS consistently achieves higher localization accuracy, better energy efficiency, and more optimized trajectories than existing approaches. These results demonstrate the framework scalability and potential for real world WSN applications, offering an intelligent and adaptable solution for data driven IoT systems.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence-generated traffic is changing the shape of wireless networks. Specifically, as the amount of data generated to train machine learning models is massive, network resources must be carefully allocated to continue supporting standard applications. In this paper, we tackle the problem of allocating radio resources for two sets of concurrent devices communicating in uplink with a gateway over the same bandwidth. A set of devices performs federated learning (FL), and accesses the medium in FDMA, uploading periodically large models. The other set is throughput-oriented and accesses the medium via random access (RA), either with ALOHA or slotted-ALOHA protocols. We derive close-to-optimal solutions to the non-convex problem of minimizing the system energy consumption subject to FL latency and RA throughput constraints. Our solutions show that ALOHA can sustain high FL efficiency, yielding up to 48% lower consumption when the system is dominated by FL traffic. On the other hand, slotted-ALOHA becomes more efficient when RA traffic dominates, yielding 6% lower consumption.

Abstract: TriCloudEdge is a scalable three-tier cloud continuum that integrates far-edge devices, intermediate edge nodes, and central cloud services, working in parallel as a unified solution. At the far edge, ultra-low-cost microcontrollers can handle lightweight AI tasks, while intermediate edge devices provide local intelligence, and the cloud tier offers large-scale analytics, federated learning, model adaptation, and global identity management. The proposed architecture enables multi-protocols and technologies (WebSocket, MQTT, HTTP) compared to a versatile protocol (Zenoh) to transfer diverse bidirectional data across the tiers, offering a balance between computational challenges and latency requirements. Comparative implementations between these two architectures demonstrate the trade-offs between resource utilization and communication efficiency. The results show that TriCloudEdge can distribute computational challenges to address latency and privacy concerns. The work also presents tests of AI model adaptation on the far edge and the computational effort challenges under the prism of parallelism. This work offers a perspective on the practical continuum challenges of implementation aligned with recent research advances addressing challenges across the different cloud levels.

Abstract: Acoustic data transmission offers a compelling alternative to Bluetooth and NFC by leveraging the ubiquitous speakers and microphones in smartphones and IoT devices. However, most research in this field relies on simulations or limited on-device testing, which makes the real-world reliability of proposed schemes difficult to assess. We systematically reviewed 31 acoustic communication studies for commodity devices and found that none provided accessible source code. After contacting authors and re-implementing three promising schemes, we assembled a testbed of eight representative acoustic communication systems. Using over 11000 smartphone transmissions in both realistic indoor environments and an anechoic chamber, we provide a systematic and repeatable methodology for evaluating the reliability and generalizability of these schemes under real-world conditions. Our results show that many existing schemes face challenges in practical usage, largely due to severe multipath propagation indoors and varying audio characteristics across device models. To support future research and foster more robust evaluations, we release our re-implementations alongside the first comprehensive dataset of real-world acoustic transmissions. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of rigorous on-device testing and underscore the need for robust design strategies to bridge the gap between simulation results and reliable IoT deployments.

Abstract: High-performance computing (HPC) centers consume substantial power, incurring environmental and operational costs. This review assesses how artificial intelligence (AI), including machine learning (ML) and optimization, improves the efficiency of operational HPC systems. Approximately 1,800 publications from 2019 to 2025 were manually screened using predefined inclusion/exclusion criteria; 74 "AI for HPC" papers were retained and grouped into six application areas: performance estimation, performance optimization, scheduling, surrogate modeling, fault detection, and language-model-based automation.
  Scheduling is the most active area, spanning research-oriented reinforcement-learning schedulers to production-friendly hybrids that combine ML with heuristics. Supervised performance estimation is foundational for both scheduling and optimization. Graph neural networks and time-series models strengthen anomaly detection by capturing spatio-temporal dependencies in production telemetry. Domain-specialized language models for HPC can outperform general-purpose LLMs on targeted coding and automation tasks. Together, these findings highlight integration opportunities such as LLM-based operating-system concepts and underscore the need for advances in MLOps, standardization of AI components, and benchmarking methodology.

Abstract: Safra's distributed termination detection algorithm employs a logical token ring structure within a distributed network; only passive nodes forward the token, and a counter in the token keeps track of the number of sent minus the number of received messages. We adapt this classic algorithm to make it fault-tolerant. The counter is split into counters per node, to discard counts from crashed nodes. If a node crashes, the token ring is restored locally and a backup token is sent. Nodes inform each other of detected crashes via the token. Our algorithm imposes no additional message overhead, tolerates any number of crashes as well as simultaneous crashes, and copes with crashes in a decentralized fashion. Correctness proofs are provided of both the original Safra's algorithm and its fault-tolerant variant, as well as a model checking analysis.

Abstract: Large-scale training systems typically use synchronous training, requiring all GPUs to be healthy simultaneously. In our experience training on O(100K) GPUs, synchronous training results in a low efficiency due to frequent failures and long recovery time.
  To address this problem, we propose a novel training paradigm, Fault Tolerant Hybrid-Shared Data Parallelism (FT-HSDP). FT-HSDP uses data parallel replicas as units of fault tolerance. When failures occur, only a single data-parallel replica containing the failed GPU or server is taken offline and restarted, while the other replicas continue training. To realize this idea at scale, FT-HSDP incorporates several techniques: 1) We introduce a Fault Tolerant All Reduce (FTAR) protocol for gradient exchange across data parallel replicas. FTAR relies on the CPU to drive the complex control logic for tasks like adding or removing participants dynamically, and relies on GPU to perform data transfer for best performance. 2) We introduce a non-blocking catch-up protocol, allowing a recovering replica to join training with minimal stall.
  Compared with fully synchronous training at O(100K) GPUs, FT-HSDP can reduce the stall time due to failure recovery from 10 minutes to 3 minutes, increasing effective training time from 44\% to 80\%. We further demonstrate that FT-HSDP's asynchronous recovery does not bring any meaning degradation to the accuracy of the result model.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training over privacy-sensitive, distributed data, but its environmental impact is difficult to compare across studies due to inconsistent measurement boundaries and heterogeneous reporting. We present a practical carbon-accounting methodology for FL CO2e tracking using NVIDIA NVFlare and CodeCarbon for explicit, phase-aware tasks (initialization, per-round training, evaluation, and idle/coordination). To capture non-compute effects, we additionally estimate communication emissions from transmitted model-update sizes under a network-configurable energy model. We validate the proposed approach on two representative workloads: CIFAR-10 image classification and retinal optic disk segmentation. In CIFAR-10, controlled client-efficiency scenarios show that system-level slowdowns and coordination effects can contribute meaningfully to carbon footprint under an otherwise fixed FL protocol, increasing total CO2e by 8.34x (medium) and 21.73x (low) relative to the high-efficiency baseline. In retinal segmentation, swapping GPU tiers (H100 vs.\ V100) yields a consistent 1.7x runtime gap (290 vs. 503 minutes) while producing non-uniform changes in total energy and CO2e across sites, underscoring the need for per-site and per-round reporting. Overall, our results support a standardized carbon accounting method that acts as a prerequisite for reproducible 'green' FL evaluation. Our code is available at https://github.com/Pediatric-Accelerated-Intelligence-Lab/carbon_footprint.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts models have become a dominant architecture for scaling Large Language Models by activating only a sparse subset of experts per token. However, latency-critical MoE inference faces a fundamental tension: while expert parallelism improves memory efficiency, it also amplifies execution stragglers. In real-world serving, continuous batching and diverse concurrent requests induce rapid semantic shifts, causing expert hotspots to migrate abruptly across GPUs and triggering the 'double penalty' of coupled computational skew and network congestion.
  We propose PROBE, an inference system that co-balances computation and communication in real time. PROBE introduces Continuous Lookahead Pipelining, which proactively predicts, plans, and prefetches for upcoming layers while keeping all control overheads off the critical path. PROBE consists of: (1) a Gate-Initialized Lookahead Predictor that distills the target router to forecast next-layer expert activation with high fidelity; (2) a Hardware-Aware Balance Planning solver that jointly optimizes dynamic expert replication and token assignment under strict hiding-window constraints; and (3) a Phase-Locked Co-Scheduling policy that uses split-phase transmission to hide bandwidth-intensive expert transfers behind computation without contending with All-to-All collectives. Experiments show that PROBE reduces prefill latency by up to 1.32X and improves decoding throughput by up to 1.26X over state-of-the-art baselines, especially under extreme workload volatility.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) towards long-context reasoning and sparse architectures has pushed memory requirements far beyond the capacity of individual device HBM. While emerging supernode architectures offer terabyte-scale shared memory pools via high-bandwidth interconnects, existing software stacks fail to exploit this hardware effectively. Current runtime-based offloading and swapping techniques operate with a local view, leading to reactive scheduling and exposed communication latency that stall the computation pipeline.
  In this paper, we propose the SuperNode Memory Management Framework (\textbf{HyperOffload}). It employs a compiler-assisted approach that leverages graph-driven memory management to treat remote memory access as explicit operations in the computation graph, specifically designed for hierarchical SuperNode architectures. Unlike reactive runtime systems, SuperNode represents data movement using cache operators within the compiler's Intermediate Representation (IR). This design enables a global, compile-time analysis of tensor lifetimes and execution dependencies. Leveraging this visibility, we develop a global execution-order refinement algorithm that statically schedules data transfers to hide remote memory latency behind compute-intensive regions. We implement SuperNode within the production deep learning framework MindSpore, adding a remote memory backend and specialized compiler passes. Evaluation on representative LLM workloads shows that SuperNode reduces peak device memory usage by up to 26\% for inference while maintaining end-to-end performance. Our work demonstrates that integrating memory-augmented hardware into the compiler's optimization framework is essential for scaling next-generation AI workloads.

Abstract: Photonic in-memory computing is a high-speed, low-energy alternative to traditional transistor-based digital computing that utilizes high photonic operating frequencies and bandwidths. In this work, we develop a comprehensive system-level performance model for photonic in-memory computing, capturing the effects of key latency sources such as external memory access and opto-electronic conversion. We perform algorithm-to-hardware mapping across a range of workloads, including the Sod shock tube problem, Matricized Tensor Times Khatri-Rao Product (MTTKRP), and the Vlasov-Maxwell equation, to evaluate how the latencies impact real-world high-performance computing workloads. Our performance model shows that, while accounting for system overheads, a compact 1x256 bit single-wavelength photonic SRAM array, fabricated using the standard silicon photonics process by GlobalFoundries, sustains up to 1.5 TOPS, 0.9 TOPS, and 1.3 TOPS on the Sod shock tube problem, MTTKRP, and the Vlasov-Maxwell equation with an average energy efficiency of 2.5 TOPS/W.

Abstract: The past decade has seen a dramatic increase in demand for GPUs to train Machine Learning (ML) models. Because it is prohibitively expensive for most organizations to build and maintain a large GPU cluster, organizations instead choose to rent GPUs from cloud providers. The customer is responsible for devising a policy for (i) deciding how many GPUs to rent at every moment in time to process a stream of ML training jobs and (ii) allocating the rented GPUs among the currently active jobs in the system. Because ML training jobs can be parallelized across different numbers of GPUs, the customer generally has many options for how many GPUs to use for each job. Allocating more GPUs to a single training job will cause the job to complete more quickly. However, the customer pays for each GPU-hour they use, and a training job receives a diminishing marginal benefit from running on additional GPUs. Hence, allocating too many GPUs to a single training job can dramatically increase the overall cost that the customer pays to the cloud provider. This gives rise to a cost-performance tradeoff that customers must balance when running training jobs in the cloud.
  To balance the cost-performance tradeoff, we develop BOA Constrictor, a new scheduler for ML training jobs which uses a Budget-Optimal Allocation (BOA) policy to squeeze the highest level of performance out of a cloud-deployed GPU cluster given a fixed budget constraint. We explicitly formulate the problem as a budget-constrained scheduling problem and derive the BOA policy which minimizes the average job completion time (JCT) of a stream of arriving jobs subject to the user's budget. For a given budget level, we demonstrate that BOA Constrictor can reduce average JCT by 1.6 times in small-scale implementation experiments and by 2 times in detailed, large-scale simulations compared to state-of-the-art heuristic based schedulers.

Abstract: Modern data centers and cloud computing clusters are increasingly running workloads composed of malleable jobs. A malleable job can be parallelized across any number of cores, yet the job typically exhibits diminishing marginal returns for each additional core on which it runs. This can be seen in the concavity of a job's speedup function, which describes the job's processing speed as a function of the number of cores on which it runs.
  Given the prevalence of malleable jobs, several theoretical works have posed the problem of how to allocate a fixed number of cores across a stream of arriving malleable jobs so as to minimize the mean response time across jobs. We refer to this as the Core Allocation to Malleable jobs (CAM) problem. We solve the CAM problem under a highly general setting, allowing for multiple job classes, each with an arbitrary concave speedup function and holding costs (weight). Furthermore, we allow for generally distributed inter-arrival times and job sizes.
  We analyze the CAM problem in the mean field asymptotic regime and derive two distinct mean field optimal policies, FW-CAM and WHAM. FW-CAM is interesting because it demonstrates a new intuition: in the mean field regime, job sizes are not relevant in finding an optimal policy. WHAM (Whittle Allocation for Malleable jobs) is interesting because it is asymptotically optimal and also serves as a good heuristic even outside of the asymptotic regime. Notably, none of the policies previously proposed in the literature are mean field optimal when jobs may follow different speedup functions.

Abstract: Cross-partition edges dominate the cost of distributed GNN training: fetching remote features and activations per iteration overwhelms the network as graphs deepen and partition counts grow. Grappa is a distributed GNN training framework that enforces gradient-only communication: during each iteration, partitions train in isolation and exchange only gradients for the global update. To recover accuracy lost to isolation, Grappa (i) periodically repartitions to expose new neighborhoods and (ii) applies a lightweight coverage-corrected gradient aggregation inspired by importance sampling. We prove the corrected estimator is asymptotically unbiased under standard support and boundedness assumptions, and we derive a batch-level variant for compatibility with common deep-learning packages that minimizes mean-squared deviation from the ideal node-level correction. We also introduce a shrinkage version that improves stability in practice. Empirical results on real and synthetic graphs show that Grappa trains GNNs 4 times faster on average (up to 13 times) than state-of-the-art systems, achieves better accuracy especially for deeper models, and sustains training at the trillion-edge scale on commodity hardware. Grappa is model-agnostic, supports full-graph and mini-batch training, and does not rely on high-bandwidth interconnects or caching.

Abstract: Any-to-any multimodal models that jointly handle text, images, video, and audio represent a significant advance in multimodal AI. However, their complex architectures (typically combining multiple autoregressive LLMs, diffusion transformers, and other specialized components) pose substantial challenges for efficient model serving. Existing serving systems are mainly tailored to a single paradigm, such as autoregressive LLMs for text generation or diffusion transformers for visual generation. They lack support for any-to-any pipelines that involve multiple interconnected model components. As a result, developers must manually handle cross-stage interactions, leading to huge performance degradation. We present vLLM-Omni, a fully disaggregated serving system for any-to-any models. vLLM-Omni features a novel stage abstraction that enables users to decompose complex any-to-any architectures into interconnected stages represented as a graph, and a disaggregated stage execution backend that optimizes resource utilization and throughput across stages. Each stage is independently served by an LLM or diffusion engine with per-stage request batching, flexible GPU allocation, and unified inter-stage connectors for data routing. Experimental results demonstrate that vLLM-Omni reduces job completion time (JCT) by up to 91.4% compared to baseline methods. The code is public available at https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-omni.

Abstract: State-of-the-art AI deep potentials provide ab initio-quality results, but at a fraction of the computational cost of first-principles quantum mechanical calculations, such as density functional theory. In this work, we bring AI deep potentials into GROMACS, a production-level Molecular Dynamics (MD) code, by integrating with DeePMD-kit that provides domain-specific deep learning (DL) models of interatomic potential energy and force fields. In particular, we enable AI deep potentials inference across multiple DP model families and DL backends by coupling GROMACS Neural Network Potentials with the C++/CUDA backend in DeePMD-kit. We evaluate two recent large-atom-model architectures, DPA2 that is based on the attention mechanism and DPA3 that is based on GNN, in GROMACS using four ab initio-quality protein-in-water benchmarks (1YRF, 1UBQ, 3LZM, 2PTC) on NVIDIA A100 and GH200 GPUs. Our results show that DPA2 delivers up to 4.23x and 3.18x higher throughput than DPA3 on A100 and GH200 GPUs, respectively. We also provide a characterization study to further contrast DPA2 and DPA3 in throughput, memory usage, and kernel-level execution on GPUs. Our findings identify kernel-launch overhead and domain-decomposed inference as the main optimization priorities for AI deep potentials in production MD simulations.

Abstract: Lakehouses are the default cloud platform for analytics and AI, but they become unsafe when untrusted actors concurrently operate on production data: upstream-downstream mismatches surface only at runtime, and multi-table pipelines can leak partial effects. Inspired by software engineering, we design Bauplan, a code-first lakehouse that aims to make (most) illegal states unrepresentable using familiar abstractions. Bauplan acts along three axes: typed table contracts to make pipeline boundaries checkable, Git-like data versioning for review and reproducibility, and transactional runs that guarantee pipeline-level atomicity. We report early results from a lightweight formal transaction model and discuss future work motivated by counterexamples.

Abstract: The study of Locally Checkable Labelings (LCLs) has led to a remarkably precise characterization of the distributed time complexities that can occur on bounded-degree trees. A central feature of this complexity landscape is the existence of strong gap results, which rule out large ranges of intermediate complexities. While it was initially hoped that these gaps might extend to more general graph classes, this has turned out not to be the case. In this work, we investigate a different direction: we remain in the class of trees, but allow arbitrarily large degrees.
  We focus on the polynomial regime ($Θ(n^{1/k} \mid k \in \mathbb{N})$) and show that whether polynomial gap results persist in the unbounded-degree setting crucially depends on how LCLs are generalized beyond bounded degrees. We first demonstrate that if one allows LCLs to be defined using infinitely many local configurations, then the polynomial gaps disappear entirely: for every real exponent $0 < r \leq 1$, there exists a locally checkable problem on trees with deterministic LOCAL complexity $Θ(n^r)$.
  Rather than stopping at this negative result, we identify a natural class of problems for which polynomial gap results can still be recovered. We introduce Locally Finite Labelings (LFLs), which formalize the intuition that ''every node must fall into one of finitely many local cases'', even in the presence of unbounded degrees.
  Our main result shows that this restriction is sufficient to restore the polynomial gaps: for any LFL $Π$ on trees with unbounded degrees, the deterministic LOCAL complexity of $Π$ is either
  - $Θ(n^{1/k})$ for some integer $k \geq 1$, or
  - $O(\log n)$.
  Moreover, which case applies, and the corresponding value of $k$, can be determined solely from the description of $Π$.

Abstract: Hierarchical federated learning (HFL) has emerged as a key architecture for large-scale wireless and Internet of Things systems, where devices communicate with nearby edge servers before reaching the cloud. In these environments, uplink bandwidth and latency impose strict communication limits, thereby making aggressive gradient compression essential. One-bit methods such as sign-based stochastic gradient descent (SignSGD) offer an attractive solution in flat federated settings, but existing theory and algorithms do not naturally extend to hierarchical settings. In particular, the interaction between majority-vote aggregation at the edge layer and model aggregation at the cloud layer, and its impact on end-to-end performance, remains unknown. To bridge this gap, we propose a highly communication-efficient sign-based HFL framework and develop its corresponding formulation for nonconvex learning, where devices send only signed stochastic gradients, edge servers combine them through majority-vote, and the cloud periodically averages the obtained edge models, while utilizing downlink quantization to broadcast the global model. We introduce the resulting scalable HFL algorithm, HierSignSGD, and provide the convergence analysis for SignSGD in a hierarchical setting. Our core technical contribution is a characterization of how biased sign compression, two-level aggregation intervals, and inter-cluster heterogeneity collectively affect convergence. Numerical experiments under homogeneous and heterogeneous data splits show that HierSignSGD, despite employing extreme compression, achieves accuracy comparable to or better than full-precision stochastic gradient descent while reducing communication cost in the process, and remains robust under aggressive downlink sparsification.

Abstract: We propose sVIRGO, a scalable virtual tree hierarchical framework for large-scale distributed systems. sVIRGO constructs virtual hierarchical trees directly on physical nodes, allowing each node to assume multiple hierarchical roles without overlay networks. The hierarchy preserves locality and is organized into configurable layers within regions. Coordination across thousands of regions is achieved via virtual upper-layer roles dynamically mapped onto nodes up to the top layer.
  Each region maintains multiple active coordinators that monitor local health and perform dynamic re-selection if failures occur. Temporary drops below the minimum threshold do not compromise coordination, ensuring near-zero recovery latency, bounded communication overhead, and exponentially reduced failure probability while maintaining safety, liveness, and robustness under mobile, interference-prone, or adversarial conditions.
  Communication is decoupled from the hierarchy and may use multi-frequency wireless links. Two message hop strategies are supported: (i) with long-distance infrastructure-assisted channels, coordinators exploit the virtual tree to minimize hops; (ii) without such channels, messages propagate via adjacent regions.
  sVIRGO also supports Layer-Scoped Command Execution. Commands and coordination actions are executed within the scope of each hierarchical layer, enabling efficient local and regional decision-making while limiting unnecessary global propagation.
