Abstract: This document presents a vision for a novel AI infrastructure design that has been initially validated through inference simulations on state-of-the-art large language models. Advancements in deep learning and specialized hardware have driven the rapid growth of large language models (LLMs) and generative AI systems. However, traditional GPU-centric architectures face scalability challenges for inference workloads due to limitations in memory capacity, bandwidth, and interconnect scaling. To address these issues, the FengHuang Platform, a disaggregated AI infrastructure platform, is proposed to overcome memory and communication scaling limits for AI inference. FengHuang features a multi-tier shared-memory architecture combining high-speed local memory with centralized disaggregated remote memory, enhanced by active tensor paging and near-memory compute for tensor operations. Simulations demonstrate that FengHuang achieves up to 93% local memory capacity reduction, 50% GPU compute savings, and 16x to 70x faster inter-GPU communication compared to conventional GPU scaling. Across workloads such as GPT-3, Grok-1, and QWEN3-235B, FengHuang enables up to 50% GPU reductions while maintaining end-user performance, offering a scalable, flexible, and cost-effective solution for AI inference infrastructure. FengHuang provides an optimal balance as a rack-level AI infrastructure scale-up solution. Its open, heterogeneous design eliminates vendor lock-in and enhances supply chain flexibility, enabling significant infrastructure and power cost reductions.

Abstract: Unit testing in High-Performance Computing (HPC) is critical but challenged by parallelism, complex algorithms, and diverse hardware. Traditional methods often fail to address non-deterministic behavior and synchronization issues in HPC applications. This paper introduces HPCAgentTester, a novel multi-agent Large Language Model (LLM) framework designed to automate and enhance unit test generation for HPC software utilizing OpenMP and MPI. HPCAgentTester employs a unique collaborative workflow where specialized LLM agents (Recipe Agent and Test Agent) iteratively generate and refine test cases through a critique loop. This architecture enables the generation of context-aware unit tests that specifically target parallel execution constructs, complex communication patterns, and hierarchical parallelism. We demonstrate HPCAgentTester's ability to produce compilable and functionally correct tests for OpenMP and MPI primitives, effectively identifying subtle bugs that are often missed by conventional techniques. Our evaluation shows that HPCAgentTester significantly improves test compilation rates and correctness compared to standalone LLMs, offering a more robust and scalable solution for ensuring the reliability of parallel software systems.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-powered agents are transforming digital devices from passive tools into proactive intelligent collaborators. However, most existing frameworks remain confined to a single OS or device, making cross-device workflows brittle and largely manual. We present UFO$^3$, a system that unifies heterogeneous endpoints, desktops, servers, mobile devices, and edge, into a single orchestration fabric. UFO$^3$ models each user request as a mutable TaskConstellation: a distributed DAG of atomic subtasks (TaskStars) with explicit control and data dependencies (TaskStarLines). The TaskConstellation continuously evolves as results stream in from distributed devices, enabling asynchronous execution, adaptive recovery, and dynamic optimization. A Constellation Orchestrator} executes tasks safely and asynchronously while applying dynamic DAG updates, and the Agent Interaction Protocol (AIP) provides persistent, low-latency channels for reliable task dispatch and result streaming. These designs dissolve the traditional boundaries between devices and platforms, allowing agents to collaborate seamlessly and amplify their collective intelligence.
  We evaluate UFO$^3$ on NebulaBench, a benchmark of 55 cross-device tasks across 5 machines and 10 categories. UFO$^3$ achieves 83.3% subtask completion, 70.9% task success, exposes parallelism with an average width of 1.72, and reduces end-to-end latency by 31% relative to a sequential baseline. Fault-injection experiments demonstrate graceful degradation and recovery under transient and permanent agent failures. These results show that UFO$^3$ achieves accurate, efficient, and resilient task orchestration across heterogeneous devices, uniting isolated agents into a coherent, adaptive computing fabric that extends across the landscape of ubiquitous computing.

Abstract: Simulation of physical systems is essential in many scientific and engineering domains. Commonly used domain decomposition methods are unable to deliver high simulation rate or high utilization in network computing environments. In particular, Exascale systems deliver only a small fraction their peak performance for these workloads. This paper introduces the novel \algorithmpropernoun{} algorithm, designed to overcome these limitations. We apply this method and show simulations running in excess of 1.6 million time steps per second and simulations achieving 84 PFLOP/s. Our implementation can achieve 90\% of peak performance in both single-node and clustered environments. We illustrate the method by applying the shallow-water equations to model a tsunami following an asteroid impact at 460m-resolution on a planetary scale running on a cluster of 64 Cerebras CS-3 systems.

Abstract: Uncrewed Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) serving as Aerial Base Stations (ABSs) are expected to extend 6G millimeter-Wave (mmWave) coverage and improve link reliability in urban areas. However, UAV-based Air-to-Ground (A2G) channels are highly dependent on height and urban geometry. This paper proposes an ABS height-dependent mmWave channel model and investigates whether urban geometry, beyond the standard built-up parameters, significantly affects LoS probability (PLoS) and Large-Scale Fading (LSF). Using MATLAB ray tracing at 26 GHz, we simulate approximately 10K city realizations for four urban layouts that share identical built-up parameters but differ in their spatial organization. We extract elevation-based PLoS using a sigmoid model and derive height-dependent Path-Loss Exponents (PLEs) and shadow-fading trends using exponential fits. Results show that PLE for Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) decreases toward 2.5-3 at high altitudes, Line-of-Sight (LoS) PLE remains near 2, and shadow fading reduces with height. We also find that geometric layout introduces a modest but consistent change in PLE (+/- 0.2), even when built-up parameters are fixed. The proposed unified model aligns well with ray-tracing statistics and offers a practical, height-dependent LSF model suitable for ABS planning in complex urban scenarios.

Abstract: We propose to enhance the dependability of large-scale IoT systems by separating the management and operation plane. We innovate the management plane to enforce overarching policies, such as safety norms, operation standards, and energy restrictions, and integrate multi-faceted management entities, including regulatory agencies and manufacturers, while the current IoT operational workflow remains unchanged. Central to the management plane is a meticulously designed, identity-independent policy framework that employs flexible descriptors rather than fixed identifiers, allowing for proactive deployment of overarching policies with adaptability to system changes. Our evaluation across three datasets indicates that the proposed framework can achieve near-optimal expressiveness and dependable policy enforcement.

Abstract: Wireless communication is evolving with the adoption of dynamic and self-organizing networks. They are expected to play a crucial role in shaping sixth-generation (6G) systems and the ongoing standardization process. The concept of non-public networks (NPNs) introduced in fifth-generation (5G) will be enhanced by nomadic non-public networks (NNPNs), extending mobility and adaptability beyond fixed locations. These networks help overcome the limitations of traditional static infrastructures, making them applicable to areas such as emergency response, transportation, agriculture, and others. This paper examines the transition from NPNs to NNPNs, highlighting key technical aspects such as network architecture, dynamic resource allocation, and wireless backhauling. Several use cases illustrate how NNPNs improve connectivity in environments where traditional networks are limited. Additionally, the study defines Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to evaluate NNPN applications and establishes a framework for categorizing them based on mobility and operational requirements. Despite their advantages, NNPNs introduce architectural, regulatory, and security challenges such as new approaches for handovers, spectrum policies or cross-border functionality, and trust mechanisms to maintain reliable operations. By identifying use cases, defining evaluation criteria, and addressing technical and regulatory challenges, this paper provides insights into integrating NNPNs into future 6G networks. These findings contribute to ongoing standardization efforts and emphasize the need for adaptable policies and network architectures to maximize the benefits of NNPNs in next-generation communication systems.

Abstract: The scaling of advanced packaging technologies provides abundant interconnection resources for 2.5D/3D heterogeneous integration (HI), thereby enabling the construction of larger-scale VLSI systems with higher energy efficiency in data movement. However, conventional I/O circuitry, including electrostatic discharge (ESD) protection and signaling, introduces significant area overhead. Prior studies have identified this overhead as a major constraint in reducing chiplet size below 100 mm2. In this study, we revisit reliability requirements from the perspective of chiplet interface design. Through parasitic extraction and SPICE simulations, we demonstrate that ESD protection and inter-chiplet signaling can be substantially simplified in future 2.5D/3D packaging technologies. Such simplification, in turn, paves the road for further chiplet miniaturization and improves the composability and reusability of tiny chiplets.

Abstract: The rapidly growing computation demands of deep neural networks (DNNs) have driven hardware vendors to integrate matrix multiplication accelerators (MMAs), such as NVIDIA Tensor Cores and AMD Matrix Cores, into modern GPUs. However, due to distinct and undocumented arithmetic specifications for floating-point matrix multiplication, some MMAs can lead to numerical imprecision and inconsistency that can compromise the stability and reproducibility of DNN training and inference.
  This paper presents MMA-Sim, the first bit-accurate reference model that reveals the detailed arithmetic behaviors of the MMAs from ten GPU architectures (eight from NVIDIA and two from AMD). By dissecting the MMAs using a combination of targeted and randomized tests, our methodology derives nine arithmetic algorithms to simulate the floating-point matrix multiplication of the MMAs. Large-scale validation confirms bitwise equivalence between MMA-Sim and the real hardware. Using MMA-Sim, we investigate arithmetic behaviors that affect DNN training stability, and identify undocumented behaviors that could lead to significant errors.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed on customer devices. To support them, current devices are adopting SoCs (System on Chip) with NPUs (Neural Processing Unit) installed. Although high performance is expected, LLM inference on NPUs is slower than its CPU counterpart. The reason is that NPUs have poor performance on computations other than GEMM, like dequantization. Current works either disaggregate prefill on the NPUs and decoding on the CPUs, or put both on the NPUs but with an accuracy loss. To solve this issue, based on the insight that low-bit can enable target computation encoded within an acceptably sized table, we propose table lookup to subsume hardware operations otherwise unsupported. To realize this, we overcome the conflicting hardware behavior of prefill and decoding to design a unified table layout and tiling through (1) fused two-level table-based dequantization and (2) concurrency-hierarchy-guided tiling. Based on that, we implement the prefill phase by three-stage pipeline and map the table-lookup-based decoding to NPU's vector units. Results show 1.4x and 3.1x speedup for prefill and decoding respectively, and 84% energy savings compared to the baseline NPU methods. The code is available at https://github.com/microsoft/T-MAC/tree/main/t-man.
