Abstract: The expanding scale of neural networks poses a major challenge for distributed machine learning, particularly under limited communication resources. While split learning (SL) alleviates client computational burden by distributing model layers between clients and server, it incurs substantial communication overhead from frequent transmission of intermediate activations and gradients. To tackle this issue, we propose NSC-SL, a bandwidth-aware adaptive compression algorithm for communication-efficient SL. NSC-SL first dynamically determines the optimal rank of low-rank approximation based on the singular value distribution for adapting real-time bandwidth constraints. Then, NSC-SL performs error-compensated tensor factorization using alternating orthogonal iteration with residual feedback, effectively minimizing truncation loss. The collaborative mechanisms enable NSC-SL to achieve high compression ratios while preserving semantic-rich information essential for convergence. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superb performance of NSC-SL.

Abstract: Telecommunications networks generate extensive performance and environmental telemetry, yet most LTE and 5G-NR deployments still rely on static, manually engineered configurations. This limits adaptability in rural, nomadic, and bandwidth-constrained environments where traffic distributions, propagation characteristics, and user behavior fluctuate rapidly. Artificial Intelligence (AI), more specifically Machine Learning (ML) models, provide new opportunities to transition Radio Access Networks (RANs) from rigid, rule-based systems toward adaptive, self-optimizing infrastructures that can respond autonomously to these dynamics. This paper proposes a practical architecture incorporating AI-assisted planning, reinforcement-learning-based RAN optimization, real-time telemetry analytics, and digital-twin-based validation. In parallel, the paper addresses the challenge of delivering embodied-AI healthcare services, educational tools, and large language model (LLM) applications to communities with insufficient backhaul for cloud computing. We introduce an edge-hosted execution model in which applications run directly on LTE/5G-NR base stations using containers, reducing latency and bandwidth consumption while improving resilience. Together, these contributions demonstrate how AI can enhance network performance, reduce operational overhead, and expand access to advanced digital services, aligning with broader goals of sustainable and inclusive network development.

Abstract: Zigbee is widely used in smart home environments due to its low power consumption and support for mesh networking, making it a relevant target for traffic-based IoT forensic analysis. However, existing studies often rely on limited datasets and fixed network configurations. In this paper, we analyze Zigbee network traffic from three complementary perspectives: data collection, traffic classification, and storage efficiency. We introduce ZIOTP2025, a publicly available dataset of Zigbee traffic collected from commercial smart home devices deployed under multiple network configurations and capturing realistic interaction scenarios. Using this dataset, we study two traffic classification tasks: device type classification and individual device identification, and evaluate their robustness under both intra-configuration and cross-configuration settings. Our results show that while high classification accuracy can be achieved under controlled conditions, performance degrades significantly when models are evaluated across different network configurations, particularly for fine-grained identification tasks. Finally, we investigate the trade-off between traffic storage requirements and classification accuracy. We show that lossy compression of traffic features through quantization can reduce storage requirements by approximately 4-5x compared to lossless storage of raw packet traces, while preserving near-lossless classification performance. Overall, our results highlight the need for topology-aware Zigbee traffic analysis and storage-efficient feature compression to enable robust and scalable IoT forensic systems.

Abstract: The rapid growth of multi-user eXtended Reality (XR) applications, spanning fields such as entertainment, education, and telemedicine, demands seamless, immersive experiences for users interacting within shared, distributed environments. Delivering such latency-sensitive experiences involves considerable challenges in orchestrating network, computing, and service resources, where existing limitations highlight the need for a structured approach to analyse and optimise these complex systems. This challenge is amplified by the need for high-performance, low-latency connectivity, where 5G and 6G networks provide essential infrastructure to meet the requirements of XR services at scale. This article addresses these challenges by developing a model that parametrises multi-user XR services across four critical layers of the standard virtualisation architecture. We formalise this model mathematically, proposing a context-aware framework that defines key parameters at each level and integrates them into a comprehensive Edge-Cloud Continuum orchestration strategy. Our contributions include a detailed analysis of the current limitations and needs in existing Edge-Cloud Continuum orchestration approaches, the formulation of a layered mathematical model, and a validation framework that demonstrates the utility and feasibility of the proposed solution.

Abstract: Stateful Middleboxes are integral part of enterprise and campus networks that provide essential in-network, security, and value-added services. These stateful middleboxes rely on precise network flow identification. However, the adoption of HTTP/3, which uses the QUIC protocol, poses significant challenges to the proper functioning of these devices. QUIC's encryption and connection migration features obscure flow semantics, disrupting middlebox visibility and functionality. We examine how QUIC disrupts middleboxes like Network Address Translators (NATs), Rate Limiters, Load Balancers, etc., and affects Kubernetes-based service deployments. To address these challenges, we propose a novel, generalized framework that enables stateful middleboxes to reliably track QUIC connections, even when the endpoints change their internet protocol (IP) address or port numbers. Our prototype implementation demonstrates that the proposed approach preserves middlebox functionality with HTTP/3 with negligible performance overhead (< 5%) on both throughput and latency, and works effectively even under high QUIC connection migration rates of up to 100 Hz.

Abstract: Video streaming is a fundamental Internet service, while the quality still cannot be guaranteed especially in poor network conditions such as bandwidth-constrained and remote areas. Existing works mainly work towards two directions: traditional pixel-codec streaming nearly approaches its limit and is hard to step further in compression; the emerging neural-enhanced or generative streaming usually fall short in latency and visual fidelity, hindering their practical deployment. Inspired by the recent success of vision foundation model (VFM), we strive to harness the powerful video understanding and processing capacities of VFM to achieve generalization, high fidelity and loss resilience for real-time video streaming with even higher compression rate. We present the first revolutionized paradigm that enables VFM-based end-to-end generative video streaming towards this goal. Specifically, Morphe employs joint training of visual tokenizers and variable-resolution spatiotemporal optimization under simulated network constraints. Additionally, a robust streaming system is constructed that leverages intelligent packet dropping to resist real-world network perturbations. Extensive evaluation demonstrates that Morphe achieves comparable visual quality while saving 62.5\% bandwidth compared to H.265, and accomplishes real-time, loss-resilient video delivery in challenging network environments, representing a milestone in VFM-enabled multimedia streaming solutions.

Abstract: In Multi-access Edge Computing networks, services can be deployed on nearby edge clouds (EC) as service function chains (SFCs) to meet strict quality of service (QoS) requirements. As users move, frequent SFC reconfigurations are required, but these are non-trivial: SFCs can serve users only when all required virtual network functions (VNFs) are available, and VNFs undergo time-consuming lifecycle operations before becoming operational. We show that ignoring lifecycle dynamics oversimplifies deployment, jeopardizes QoS, and must be avoided in practical SFC management. To address this, forecasts of user connectivity can be leveraged to proactively deploy VNFs and reconfigure SFCs. But forecasts are inherently imperfect, requiring lifecycle and connectivity uncertainty to be jointly considered. We present RIPPLE, a lifecycle-aware SFC embedding approach to deploy VNFs at the right time and location, reducing service interruptions. We show that RIPPLE closes the gap with solutions that unrealistically assume instantaneous lifecycle, even under realistic lifecycle constraints.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly becoming critical infrastructure for enterprise applications, driving unprecedented demand for GPU-based inference services. A key operational challenge arises from the two-phase nature of LLM inference: a compute-intensive \emph{prefill} phase that processes user input, followed by a memory-bound \emph{decode} phase that generates output tokens. When these phases share GPU resources, prefill tasks throttle the processing speed of concurrent decodes, creating state-dependent contention. This contention is further complicated by workload heterogeneity, as different applications exhibit vastly different input and output lengths. We develop a stochastic control framework for scheduling heterogeneous LLM workloads across large GPU clusters. We formulate LLM inference as a multiclass many-server queueing network with state-dependent service rates, grounded in empirical iteration-time measurements. We analyze the fluid approximation of this system and solve steady-state linear programs that characterize optimal resource allocation. We design gate-and-route policies that regulate prefill admission and decode routing, and prove that they are asymptotically optimal in the many-GPU limit under both bundled and separate token-pricing schemes. We further extend the framework to incorporate Service Level Indicators (SLIs) such as latency and fairness, providing a general approach to constrained scheduling. Numerical experiments calibrated to empirical iteration-time data demonstrate that our policies outperform standard serving heuristics.

Abstract: Dynamic scheduling of task graphs is often addressed without revisiting prior task allocations, with a primary focus on minimizing makespan. We study controlled schedule preemption, introducing the Last-K Preemption model, which selectively reschedules recent task graphs while preserving earlier allocations. Using synthetic, RIoTBench, WFCommons, and adversarial workloads, we compare preemptive, non-preemptive, and partial-preemptive strategies across makespan, fairness, utilization, and runtime. Results show moderate preemption can match most makespan and utilization gains of full preemption while maintaining fairness and low overhead.

Abstract: This paper studies an important rate allocation problem that arises in many networked and distributed systems: steady-state traffic rate allocation from multiple sources to multiple service nodes when both (i) the access-path delay on each source-node route is rate-dependent (capacity-constrained) and convex, and (ii) each service node (also capacity-constrained) experiences a load-dependent queueing delay driven by aggregate load from all sources. We show that the resulting flow-weighted end-to-end delay minimization is a convex program, yielding a global system-optimal solution characterized by KKT conditions that equalize total marginal costs (a path marginal access term plus a node congestion price) across all utilized routes. This condition admits a Wardrop-type interpretation: for each source, all utilized options equalize total marginal cost, while any option with strictly larger total marginal cost receives no flow. Building on this structure, we develop a lightweight distributed pricing-based algorithm in which each service node locally computes and broadcasts a scalar congestion price from its observed aggregate load, while each source updates its traffic split by solving a small separable convex allocation problem under the advertised prices. Numerical illustrations demonstrate convergence of the distributed iteration to the centralized optimum and highlight the trade-offs induced by jointly modeling access and service congestion.

Abstract: Blockchain validators can reduce block processing time by exploiting multi-core CPUs, but deterministic execution must preserve a given total order while respecting transaction conflicts and per-block runtime limits. This paper systematically examines how validators can exploit multi-core parallelism during both block construction and execution without violating blockchain semantics. We formalize two validator-side optimization problems: (i) executing an already ordered block on \(p\) cores to minimize makespan while ensuring equivalence to sequential execution; and (ii) selecting and scheduling a subset of mempool transactions under a runtime limit \(B\) to maximize validator reward. For both, we develop exact Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) formulations that capture conflict, order, and capacity constraints, and propose fast deterministic heuristics that scale to realistic workloads. Using Ethereum mainnet traces and including a Solana-inspired declared-access baseline (Sol) for ordered-block scheduling and a simple reward-greedy baseline (RG) for block construction, we empirically quantify the trade-offs between optimality and runtime.

Abstract: Agreement is a foundational problem in distributed computing that have been studied extensively for over four decades. Recently, Meir, Mirault, Peleg and Robinson introduced the notion of \emph{Energy Efficient Agreement}, where the goal is to solve Agreement while minimizing the number of round a party participates in, thereby reducing the energy cost per participant. We show a recursive Agreement algorithm that has $O(\log f)$ active rounds per participant, where $f<n$ represents the maximum number of crash faults in the system.

Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures significantly enhance the capacity of LLMs without proportional increases in computation, but at the cost of a vast parameter size. Offloading MoE expert parameters to host memory and leveraging both CPU and GPU computation has recently emerged as a promising direction to support such models on resourceconstrained local PC platforms. While promising, we notice that existing approaches mismatch the dynamic nature of expert workloads, which leads to three fundamental inefficiencies: (1) Static expert assignment causes severe CPUGPU load imbalance, underutilizing CPU and GPU resources; (2) Existing prefetching techniques fail to accurately predict high-workload experts, leading to costly inaccurate prefetches; (3) GPU cache policies neglect workload dynamics, resulting in poor hit rates and limited effectiveness. To address these challenges, we propose DALI, a workloaDAware offLoadIng framework for efficient MoE inference on local PCs. To fully utilize hardware resources, DALI first dynamically assigns experts to CPU or GPU by modeling assignment as a 0-1 integer optimization problem and solving it efficiently using a Greedy Assignment strategy at runtime. To improve prefetching accuracy, we develop a Residual-Based Prefetching method leveraging inter-layer residual information to accurately predict high-workload experts. Additionally, we introduce a Workload-Aware Cache Replacement policy that exploits temporal correlation in expert activations to improve GPU cache efficiency. By evaluating across various MoE models and settings, DALI achieves significant speedups in the both prefill and decoding phases over the state-of-the-art offloading frameworks.

Abstract: Modern distributed optimization methods mostly rely on traditional synchronous approaches, despite substantial recent progress in asynchronous optimization. We revisit Synchronous SGD and its robust variant, called $m$-Synchronous SGD, and theoretically show that they are nearly optimal in many heterogeneous computation scenarios, which is somewhat unexpected. We analyze the synchronous methods under random computation times and adversarial partial participation of workers, and prove that their time complexities are optimal in many practical regimes, up to logarithmic factors. While synchronous methods are not universal solutions and there exist tasks where asynchronous methods may be necessary, we show that they are sufficient for many modern heterogeneous computation scenarios.
