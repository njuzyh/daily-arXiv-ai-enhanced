We propose a novel geometric framework that models an\nLLM's reasoning as flows -- embedding trajectories evolving where logic goes.\nWe disentangle logical structure from semantics by employing the same natural\ndeduction propositions with varied semantic carriers, allowing us to test\nwhether LLMs internalize logic beyond surface form. This perspective connects\nreasoning with geometric quantities such as position, velocity, and curvature,\nenabling formal analysis in representation and concept spaces. Our theory\nestablishes: (1) LLM reasoning corresponds to smooth flows in representation\nspace, and (2) logical statements act as local controllers of these flows'\nvelocities. Using learned representation proxies, we design controlled\nexperiments to visualize and quantify reasoning flows, providing empirical\nvalidation of our theoretical framework. Our work serves as both a conceptual\nfoundation and practical tools for studying reasoning phenomenon, offering a\nnew lens for interpretability and formal analysis of LLMs' behavior."}

While numerous benchmarks measure agent accuracy across domains,\nthey mostly assume full automation, failing to represent the collaborative\nnature of real-world use cases. In this paper, we make two major steps towards\nthe rigorous assessment of human-agent interactions. First, we propose PULSE, a\nframework for more efficient human-centric evaluation of agent designs, which\ncomprises collecting user feedback, training an ML model to predict user\nsatisfaction, and computing results by combining human satisfaction ratings\nwith model-generated pseudo-labels. Second, we deploy the framework on a\nlarge-scale web platform built around the open-source software agent OpenHands,\ncollecting in-the-wild usage data across over 15k users. We conduct case\nstudies around how three agent design decisions -- choice of LLM backbone,\nplanning strategy, and memory mechanisms -- impact developer satisfaction\nrates, yielding practical insights for software agent design. We also show how\nour framework can lead to more robust conclusions about agent design, reducing\nconfidence intervals by 40\\% compared to a standard A/B test. Finally, we find\nsubstantial discrepancies between in-the-wild results and benchmark performance\n(e.g., the anti-correlation between results comparing claude-sonnet-4 and\ngpt-5), underscoring the limitations of benchmark-driven evaluation. Our\nfindings provide guidance for evaluations of LLM agents with humans and\nidentify opportunities for better agent designs."}

However, such EO-driven representations remain\nlimited in capturing the functional and socioeconomic dimensions of cities, as\nthey primarily encode physical and spectral patterns rather than human\nactivities or spatial functions.

To this end, we propose Position-wise\nInjection with eXact Estimated Levels (PIXEL), a position-wise activation\nsteering framework that, in contrast to prior work, learns a property-aligned\nsubspace from dual views (tail-averaged and end-token) and selects intervention\nstrength via a constrained geometric objective with a closed-form solution,\nthereby adapting to token-level sensitivity without global hyperparameter\ntuning.

In this paper, we investigate this question by proposing a\nPerturbation-based Causal Identification of Critical Neurons method to\nsystematically locate such critical neurons in LLMs. Our findings reveal three\nkey insights: (1) LLMs contain ultra-sparse critical neuron sets. Disrupting\nthese critical neurons can cause a 72B-parameter model with over 1.1 billion\nneurons to completely collapse, with perplexity increasing by up to 20 orders\nof magnitude; (2) These critical neurons are not uniformly distributed, but\ntend to concentrate in the outer layers, particularly within the MLP down\\_proj\ncomponents; (3) Performance degradation exhibits sharp phase transitions,\nrather than a gradual decline, when these critical neurons are disrupted.\nThrough comprehensive experiments across diverse model architectures and\nscales, we provide deeper analysis of these phenomena and their implications\nfor LLM robustness and interpretability.

However, many existing frameworks for\nbuilding these systems introduce significant complexity, a steep learning\ncurve, and substantial boilerplate code, hindering rapid prototyping and\ndeployment. This paper introduces simpliflow, a lightweight, open-source Python\nframework designed to address these challenges. simpliflow enables the rapid\ndevelopment and orchestration of linear, deterministic agentic workflows\nthrough a declarative, JSON-based configuration. Its modular architecture\ndecouples agent management, workflow execution, and post-processing, promoting\nease of use and extensibility. By integrating with LiteLLM, it supports over\n100 Large Language Models (LLMs) out-of-the-box. We present the architecture,\noperational flow, and core features of simpliflow, demonstrating its utility\nthrough diverse use cases ranging from software development simulation to\nreal-time system interaction. A comparative analysis with prominent frameworks\nlike LangChain and AutoGen highlights simpliflow's unique position as a tool\noptimized for simplicity, control, and speed in deterministic workflow\nenvironments."}

This\ncognitive gap leads to responses that are superficial, brittle and\nshort-sighted. To address this, we propose Critique-Driven Reasoning Alignment\n(CDRA), which reframes alignment from a scalar reward-matching task into a\nstructured reasoning process. First, to bridge the preference inference gap, we\nintroduce the DeepPref benchmark. This dataset, comprising 3000\npreference-query pairs across 20 topics, is curated by simulating a\nmulti-faceted cognitive council that produces critique-annotated reasoning\nchains to deconstruct query semantics and reveal latent risks. Second, to\ninstill defensive reasoning, we introduce the Personalized Generative Process\nReward Model (Pers-GenPRM), which frames reward modeling as a personalized\nreasoning task. It generates a critique chain to evaluate a response's\nalignment with user preferences before outputting a final score based on this\nrationale. Ultimately, this interpretable, structured reward signal guides\npolicy model through Critique-Driven Policy Alignment, a process-level online\nreinforcement learning algorithm integrating both numerical and natural\nlanguage feedback.

Unlike prior work that relies on manual graph construction or\nunstructured reasoning, PADME autonomously transforms procedural text into\nexecutable graphs that capture task dependencies, decision points, and reusable\nsubroutines. Central to PADME is a two-phase methodology; Teach phase, which\nfocuses on systematic structuring, enrichment with executable logic of\nprocedures, followed by Execute phase, which enables dynamic execution in\nresponse to real-time inputs and environment feedback. This separation ensures\nquality assurance and scalability, allowing expert knowledge to be encoded once\nand reliably reused across varying contexts. The graph representation also\nprovides an inductive bias that reduces error accumulation in long-horizon\nreasoning, underscoring the importance of structured procedure modeling for\nreliable agent-driven automation.
