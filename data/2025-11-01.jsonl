To mitigate this,\nMixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures activate only a small portion of\nparameters during inference, significantly lowering both memory demand and\ncomputational overhead. However, conventional MoE inference approaches, which\nselect active experts independently at each layer, often introduce considerable\nlatency because of frequent parameter transfers between host and GPU memory. In\naddition, current cross-layer prediction strategies, which are typically based\non fixed steps, lack adaptability across different hardware platforms and\nworkloads, thereby reducing their robustness and effectiveness.\n  To address these challenges, we present ExpertFlow, a runtime system for MoE\ninference that combines adaptive expert prefetching and cache-aware routing.\nExpertFlow continuously adjusts its prediction horizon for expert activation by\nleveraging runtime statistics such as transfer bandwidth, parameter\ndimensionality, and model feedback signals. Furthermore, it incorporates a\nhybrid cross-layer prediction scheme that fuses pregating information with\nintermediate computational states to anticipate future expert needs. By\nadaptively refining prefetching decisions and aligning them with actual usage\nbehavior, ExpertFlow effectively decreases cache misses and removes latency\ncaused by expert swap-ins. Our evaluation demonstrates that ExpertFlow reduces\nmodel stall time to less than 0.1% of the baseline, highlighting its capability\nto optimize MoE inference under stringent memory constraints."}

Our analysis reveals\na fundamental trade-off in protocol design between predictable performance\n(efficiency, convergence) and user-centric goals (fairness, responsiveness). We\nprove, however, that no such trade-off exists among efficiency, convergence,\nand loss avoidance, which can be simultaneously optimized through careful\nparameter tuning.

This paper introduces a symmetry-driven asynchronous forwarding\nmechanism that leverages the torus's geometric properties to achieve reliable\npacket delivery without control-plane coordination.

Given that this problem is\nNP-hard, DRL-based methods have been proposed to infer the near-optimal\nsolutions in real-time, yet this approach has an intrinsic security problem.\nThis paper investigates how a group of adversarial users can exploit\nunsanitized raw CSIs to launch a throughput degradation attack. Most existing\nstudies only focused on systems in which adversarial users can obtain the exact\nvalues of victims' CSIs, but this is impractical in the case of uplink\ntransmission in LTE/5G mobile systems. We note that the DRL policy contains an\nobservation normalizer which has the mean and variance of the observation to\nimprove training convergence. Adversarial users can then estimate the upper and\nlower bounds of the local observations including the CSIs of victims based\nsolely on that observation normalizer. We develop an attacking scheme FGGM by\nleveraging polytope abstract domains, a technique used to bound the outputs of\na neural network given the input ranges. Our goal is to find one set of\nintentionally manipulated CSIs which can achieve the attacking goals for the\nwhole range of local observations of victims.

Originally designed to facilitate\nthe resolution of host names to IP addresses, its scope has continuously\nexpanded over the years, today covering use cases such as load balancing or\nservice discovery. While DNS was initially conceived as a rather static\ndirectory service in which resource records (RR) only change rarely, we have\nseen a number of use cases over the years where a DNS flavor that isn't purely\nbased upon requesting and caching RRs, but rather on an active distribution of\nupdates for all resolvers that showed interest in the respective records in the\npast, would be preferable. In this paper, we thus explore a publish-subscribe\nvariant of DNS based on the Media-over-QUIC architecture, where we devise a\nstrawman system and protocol proposal to enable pushing RR updates. We provide\na prototype implementation, finding that DNS can benefit from a\npublish-subscribe variant: next to limiting update traffic, it can considerably\nreduce the time it takes for a resolver to receive the latest version of a\nrecord, thereby supporting use cases such as load balancing in content\ndistribution networks.
