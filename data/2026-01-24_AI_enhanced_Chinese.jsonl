FlexLLM exposes key architectural degrees of freedom for stage-customized inference, enabling hybrid designs that tailor temporal reuse and spatial dataflow differently for prefill and decode, and provides a comprehensive quantization suite to support accurate low-bit deployment. Using FlexLLM, we build a complete inference system for the Llama-3.2 1B model in under two months with only 1K lines of code. The system includes: (1) a stage-customized accelerator with hardware-efficient quantization (12.68 WikiText-2 PPL) surpassing SpinQuant baseline, and (2) a Hierarchical Memory Transformer (HMT) plug-in for efficient long-context processing. On the AMD U280 FPGA at 16nm, the accelerator achieves 1.29$\\times$ end-to-end speedup, 1.64$\\times$ higher decode throughput, and 3.14$\\times$ better energy efficiency than an NVIDIA A100 GPU (7nm) running BF16 inference; projected results on the V80 FPGA at 7nm reach 4.71$\\times$, 6.55$\\times$, and 4.13$\\times$, respectively.

SNNs operate by propagating spikes between neurons that form a graph through synapses. Neuromorphic hardware mimics them through a network-on-chip, transmitting spikes, and a mesh of cores, each managing several neurons. Its operational cost is tied to spike movement and active cores. A mapping comprises two tasks: partitioning the SNN's graph to fit inside cores and placement of each partition on the hardware mesh. Both are NP-hard problems, and as SNNs and hardware scale towards billions of neurons, they become increasingly difficult to tackle effectively. In this work, we propose to raise the abstraction of SNNs from graphs to hypergraphs, redesigning mapping techniques accordingly. The resulting model faithfully captures the replication of spikes inside cores by exposing the notion of hyperedge co-membership between neurons. We further show that the overlap and locality of hyperedges strongly correlate with high-quality mappings, making these properties instrumental in devising mapping algorithms. By exploiting them directly, grouping neurons through shared hyperedges, communication traffic and hardware resource usage can be reduced be yond what just contracting individual connections attains. To substantiate this insight, we consider several partitioning and placement algorithms, some newly devised, others adapted from literature, and compare them over progressively larger and bio-plausible SNNs. Our results show that hypergraph based techniques can achieve better mappings than the state-of-the-art at several execution time regimes. Based on these observations, we identify a promising selection of algorithms to achieve effective mappings at any scale.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "challenges": "Challenges extraction failed", "contributions": "Contributions extraction failed", "results": "Results analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed", "related_work": "Related work extraction failed"}}

However, optimally sharing and allocating spectrum and power resources to maintain MC while ensuring reliable connectivity and optimal performance remains challeng- ing in such networks. Channel variations induced by mobility in UAV networks, coupled with the varying quality of service (QoS) demands of heterogeneous devices, resource sharing, and fairness requirements in capacity distribution pose challenges to optimal resource allocation. Thus, this paper investigates resource allocation for QoS-constrained, MC-enabled, dynamic UAVs in an integrated TN-NTN environment with spectrum sharing and fairness considerations. To this end, we consider three types of links: UAV-to-radio base station (RBS), UAV-to-UAV, and UAV-to-HAP. We also assume two types of UAVs with diverse QoS requirements to reflect a practical scenario. Consequently, we propose two algorithms. The first algorithm maximizes the capacity of UAVs-RBS and UAVs-HAP links while ensuring the reliability of the UAV-UAV link. To achieve this, the algorithm maximizes the collective throughput of the UAVs by optimizing the sum capacity of all the UAV-RBS and UAV-HAP links. Next, to provide constant capacity to all links and ensure fairness, we propose another algorithm that maximizes the minimum capacity across all links. We validate the performance of both algorithms through simulation", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "challenges": "Challenges extraction failed", "contributions": "Contributions extraction failed", "results": "Results analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed", "related_work": "Related work extraction failed"}}

Experimental evaluation using the Lennard-Jones FRNN interaction model as a case study shows that the proposed update/rebuild ratio optimizer is capable of adapting to the different dynamics that emerge during a simulation, leading to a RT core pipeline up to $\\sim 3.4\\times$ faster than with other known approaches to manage the BVH. In terms of simulation step performance, the proposed variants can significantly improve the speedup and EE of the base RT core idea; from $\\sim1.3\\times$ at small radius to $\\sim2.0\\times$ for log normal radius distributions. Furthermore, the proposed variants manage to simulate cases that would otherwise not fit in memory because of the use of neighbor lists, such as clusters of particles with log normal radius distribution. The proposed RT Core technique to support periodic BC is indeed effective as it does not introduce any significant penalty in performance. In terms of scaling, the proposed methods scale both their performance and EE across GPU generations.

However, for robots to navigate and operate seamlessly, efficiently and reliably, they must have an accurate understanding of both their surrounding environment and the quality of radio signals. Achieving this in highly dynamic and ever-changing environments remains a challenging and largely unsolved problem. In this paper, we introduce MapViT, a two-stage Vision Transformer (ViT)-based framework inspired by the success of pre-train and fine-tune paradigm for Large Language Models (LLMs). MapViT is designed to predict both environmental changes and expected radio signal quality. We evaluate the framework using a set of representative Machine Learning (ML) models, analyzing their respective strengths and limitations across different scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed two-stage pipeline enables real-time prediction, with the ViT-based implementation achieving a strong balance between accuracy and computational efficiency. This makes MapViT a promising solution for energy- and resource-constrained platforms such as mobile robots. Moreover, the geometry foundation model derived from the self-supervised pre-training stage improves data efficiency and transferability, enabling effective downstream predictions even with limited labeled data.

This paper introduces ACI, a non-myopic, frame-based scheduling framework that directly amortizes these switching delays.

As a pivotal component of the LAE, low-altitude uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) can restore communication by serving as aerial relays between the post-disaster areas and remote base stations (BSs). However, conventional approaches face challenges from vulnerable long-distance links between the UAVs and remote BSs, and data bottlenecks arising from massive data volumes and limited onboard UAV resources. In this work, we investigate a low-altitude multi-UAV-assisted data collection and semantic forwarding network, in which multiple UAVs collect data from ground users, form clusters, perform intra-cluster data aggregation with semantic extraction, and then cooperate as virtual antenna array (VAAs) to transmit the extracted semantic information to a remote BS via collaborative beamforming (CB). We formulate a data collection and semantic forwarding multi-objective optimization problem (DCSFMOP) that jointly maximizes both the user and semantic transmission rates while minimizing UAV energy consumption. The formulated DCSFMOP is a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem that is inherently NP-hard and characterized by dynamically varying decision variable dimensionality. To address these challenges, we propose a large language model-enabled alternating optimization approach (LLM-AOA), which effectively handles the complex search space and variable dimensionality by optimizing different subsets of decision variables through tailored optimization strategies.
