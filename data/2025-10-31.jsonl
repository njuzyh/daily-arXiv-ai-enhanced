A large number of connections are\ngoing to be heterogeneous, demanding lesser delays, higher data rates, superior\nthroughput and enhanced system capacity. The available spectrum resources are\nlimited and has to be flexibly used by mobile network operators to cope with\nthe rising demands. An emerging facilitator of the upcoming high data rate\ndemanding next-generation networks are device-to-device(D2D) communication.\nThis paper has developed a model that establishes Device-to-Device (D2D)\ncommunication between two end-users without involving the eNB (evolved Node B).\nWe have sharded the UEs and CUs based on the criteria of DISTANCE. To do so, we\nused the K-means clustering method."}

To address this, we propose a novel\ncooperative rate-splitting (CRS)-aided transmission framework, where an\naboveground relay decodes and forwards the common stream to underground devices\n(UDs). Based on this framework, we formulate a max-min fairness optimization\nproblem that jointly optimizes power allocation, message splitting, and time\nslot scheduling to maximize the minimum achievable rate across UDs. To solve\nthis high-dimensional non-convex problem under uncertain channels, we develop a\ndeep reinforcement learning solution framework based on the proximal policy\noptimization (PPO) algorithm that integrates distribution-aware action modeling\nand a multi-branch actor network. Simulation results under a realistic\nunderground pipeline monitoring scenario demonstrate that the proposed approach\nachieves average max-min rate gains exceeding $167\\%$ over conventional\nbenchmark strategies across various numbers of UDs and underground conditions."}

The final version\n  of record will appear in IEEE Xplore", "summary": "As augmented and virtual reality evolve, achieving seamless synchronization\nbetween physical and digital realms remains a critical challenge, especially\nfor real-time applications where delays affect the user experience. This paper\npresents MetaLore, a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) based framework for\njoint communication and computational resource allocation in Metaverse or\ndigital twin environments. MetaLore dynamically shares the communication\nbandwidth and computational resources among sensors and mobile devices to\noptimize synchronization, while offering high throughput performance. Special\ntreatment is given in satisfying end-to-end delay guarantees. A key\ncontribution is the introduction of two novel Age of Information (AoI) metrics:\nAge of Request Information (AoRI) and Age of Sensor Information (AoSI),\nintegrated into the reward function to enhance synchronization quality. An open\nsource simulator has been extended to incorporate and evaluate the approach.\nThe DRL solution is shown to achieve the performance of full-enumeration\nbrute-force solutions by making use of a small, task-oriented observation space\nof two queue lengths at the network side. This allows the DRL approach the\nflexibility to effectively and autonomously adapt to dynamic traffic\nconditions."}
