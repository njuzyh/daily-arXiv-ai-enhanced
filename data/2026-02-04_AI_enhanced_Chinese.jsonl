Accurate EM analysis requires solving stress-governing partial differential equations over large interconnect trees, which is computationally expensive using conventional finite-difference methods. This work proposes two fast EM stress analysis techniques based on rational Krylov subspace reduction. Unlike traditional Krylov methods that expand around zero frequency, rational Krylov methods enable expansion at selected time constants, aligning directly with metrics such as nucleation and steady-state times and producing compact reduced models with minimal accuracy loss. Two complementary frameworks are developed: a frequency-domain extended rational Krylov method, ExtRaKrylovEM, and a time-domain rational Krylov exponential integration method, EiRaKrylovEM. We show that the accuracy of both methods depends strongly on the choice of expansion point, or shift time, and demonstrate that effective shift times are typically close to times of interest such as nucleation or post-void steady state. Based on this observation, a coordinate descent optimization strategy is introduced to automatically determine optimal reduction orders and shift times for both nucleation and post-void phases. Experimental results on synthesized structures and industry-scale power grids show that the proposed methods achieve orders-of-magnitude improvements in efficiency and accuracy over finite-difference solutions. Using only 4 to 6 Krylov orders, the methods achieve sub-0.1 percent error in nucleation time and resistance change predictions while delivering 20 to 500 times speedup. In contrast, standard extended Krylov methods require more than 50 orders and still incur 10 to 20 percent nucleation time error, limiting their practicality for EM-aware optimization and stochastic EM analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "challenges": "Challenges extraction failed", "contributions": "Contributions extraction failed", "results": "Results analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed", "related_work": "Related work extraction failed"}}

Today, the emergence of autonomous, learning-based systems introduces a new architectural challenge: intelligence is increasingly embedded directly into network control, computation, and decision-making, yet the Internet lacks a structural foundation for representing and exchanging meaning. In this paper, we argue that cognition alone: pattern recognition, prediction, and optimization, is insufficient for the next generation of networked systems. As autonomous agents act across safety-critical and socio-technical domains, systems must not only compute and communicate, but also comprehend intent, context, and consequence. We introduce the concept of a Semantic Layer: a new architectural stratum that treats meaning as a first-class construct, enabling interpretive alignment, semantic accountability, and intelligible autonomous behavior. We show that this evolution leads naturally to a Syntactic-Semantic Internet. The syntactic stack continues to transport bits, packets, and workloads with speed and reliability, while a parallel semantic stack transports meaning, grounding, and consequence. We describe the structure of this semantic stack-semantic communication, a semantic substrate, and an emerging Agentic Web, and draw explicit architectural parallels to TCP/IP and the World Wide Web.

While emerging supernode architectures offer terabyte-scale shared memory pools via high-bandwidth interconnects, existing software stacks fail to exploit this hardware effectively. Current runtime-based offloading and swapping techniques operate with a local view, leading to reactive scheduling and exposed communication latency that stall the computation pipeline.\n  In this paper, we propose the SuperNode Memory Management Framework (\\textbf{HyperOffload}). It employs a compiler-assisted approach that leverages graph-driven memory management to treat remote memory access as explicit operations in the computation graph, specifically designed for hierarchical SuperNode architectures. Unlike reactive runtime systems, SuperNode represents data movement using cache operators within the compiler's Intermediate Representation (IR). This design enables a global, compile-time analysis of tensor lifetimes and execution dependencies. Leveraging this visibility, we develop a global execution-order refinement algorithm that statically schedules data transfers to hide remote memory latency behind compute-intensive regions. We implement SuperNode within the production deep learning framework MindSpore, adding a remote memory backend and specialized compiler passes. Evaluation on representative LLM workloads shows that SuperNode reduces peak device memory usage by up to 26\\% for inference while maintaining end-to-end performance.

Because it is prohibitively expensive for most organizations to build and maintain a large GPU cluster, organizations instead choose to rent GPUs from cloud providers. The customer is responsible for devising a policy for (i) deciding how many GPUs to rent at every moment in time to process a stream of ML training jobs and (ii) allocating the rented GPUs among the currently active jobs in the system. Because ML training jobs can be parallelized across different numbers of GPUs, the customer generally has many options for how many GPUs to use for each job. Allocating more GPUs to a single training job will cause the job to complete more quickly. However, the customer pays for each GPU-hour they use, and a training job receives a diminishing marginal benefit from running on additional GPUs. Hence, allocating too many GPUs to a single training job can dramatically increase the overall cost that the customer pays to the cloud provider. This gives rise to a cost-performance tradeoff that customers must balance when running training jobs in the cloud.\n  To balance the cost-performance tradeoff, we develop BOA Constrictor, a new scheduler for ML training jobs which uses a Budget-Optimal Allocation (BOA) policy to squeeze the highest level of performance out of a cloud-deployed GPU cluster given a fixed budget constraint. We explicitly formulate the problem as a budget-constrained scheduling problem and derive the BOA policy which minimizes the average job completion time (JCT) of a stream of arriving jobs subject to the user's budget. For a given budget level, we demonstrate that BOA Constrictor can reduce average JCT by 1.6 times in small-scale implementation experiments and by 2 times in detailed, large-scale simulations compared to state-of-the-art heuristic based schedulers.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "challenges": "Challenges extraction failed", "contributions": "Contributions extraction failed", "results": "Results analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed", "related_work": "Related work extraction failed"}}

A malleable job can be parallelized across any number of cores, yet the job typically exhibits diminishing marginal returns for each additional core on which it runs. This can be seen in the concavity of a job's speedup function, which describes the job's processing speed as a function of the number of cores on which it runs.\n  Given the prevalence of malleable jobs, several theoretical works have posed the problem of how to allocate a fixed number of cores across a stream of arriving malleable jobs so as to minimize the mean response time across jobs. We refer to this as the Core Allocation to Malleable jobs (CAM) problem. We solve the CAM problem under a highly general setting, allowing for multiple job classes, each with an arbitrary concave speedup function and holding costs (weight). Furthermore, we allow for generally distributed inter-arrival times and job sizes.\n  We analyze the CAM problem in the mean field asymptotic regime and derive two distinct mean field optimal policies, FW-CAM and WHAM. FW-CAM is interesting because it demonstrates a new intuition: in the mean field regime, job sizes are not relevant in finding an optimal policy. WHAM (Whittle Allocation for Malleable jobs) is interesting because it is asymptotically optimal and also serves as a good heuristic even outside of the asymptotic regime.

In this work, we investigate a different direction: we remain in the class of trees, but allow arbitrarily large degrees.\n  We focus on the polynomial regime ($\u0398(n^{1/k} \\mid k \\in \\mathbb{N})$) and show that whether polynomial gap results persist in the unbounded-degree setting crucially depends on how LCLs are generalized beyond bounded degrees. We first demonstrate that if one allows LCLs to be defined using infinitely many local configurations, then the polynomial gaps disappear entirely: for every real exponent $0 < r \\leq 1$, there exists a locally checkable problem on trees with deterministic LOCAL complexity $\u0398(n^r)$.\n  Rather than stopping at this negative result, we identify a natural class of problems for which polynomial gap results can still be recovered. We introduce Locally Finite Labelings (LFLs), which formalize the intuition that ''every node must fall into one of finitely many local cases'', even in the presence of unbounded degrees.\n  Our main result shows that this restriction is sufficient to restore the polynomial gaps: for any LFL $\u03a0$ on trees with unbounded degrees, the deterministic LOCAL complexity of $\u03a0$ is either\n  - $\u0398(n^{1/k})$ for some integer $k \\geq 1$, or\n  - $O(\\log n)$.\n  Moreover, which case applies, and the corresponding value of $k$, can be determined solely from the description of $\u03a0$.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "challenges": "Challenges extraction failed", "contributions": "Contributions extraction failed", "results": "Results analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed", "related_work": "Related work extraction failed"}}

In these environments, uplink bandwidth and latency impose strict communication limits, thereby making aggressive gradient compression essential. One-bit methods such as sign-based stochastic gradient descent (SignSGD) offer an attractive solution in flat federated settings, but existing theory and algorithms do not naturally extend to hierarchical settings. In particular, the interaction between majority-vote aggregation at the edge layer and model aggregation at the cloud layer, and its impact on end-to-end performance, remains unknown. To bridge this gap, we propose a highly communication-efficient sign-based HFL framework and develop its corresponding formulation for nonconvex learning, where devices send only signed stochastic gradients, edge servers combine them through majority-vote, and the cloud periodically averages the obtained edge models, while utilizing downlink quantization to broadcast the global model. We introduce the resulting scalable HFL algorithm, HierSignSGD, and provide the convergence analysis for SignSGD in a hierarchical setting. Our core technical contribution is a characterization of how biased sign compression, two-level aggregation intervals, and inter-cluster heterogeneity collectively affect convergence. Numerical experiments under homogeneous and heterogeneous data splits show that HierSignSGD, despite employing extreme compression, achieves accuracy comparable to or better than full-precision stochastic gradient descent while reducing communication cost in the process, and remains robust under aggressive downlink sparsification.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "challenges": "Challenges extraction failed", "contributions": "Contributions extraction failed", "results": "Results analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed", "related_work": "Related work extraction failed"}}

The hierarchy preserves locality and is organized into configurable layers within regions. Coordination across thousands of regions is achieved via virtual upper-layer roles dynamically mapped onto nodes up to the top layer.\n  Each region maintains multiple active coordinators that monitor local health and perform dynamic re-selection if failures occur. Temporary drops below the minimum threshold do not compromise coordination, ensuring near-zero recovery latency, bounded communication overhead, and exponentially reduced failure probability while maintaining safety, liveness, and robustness under mobile, interference-prone, or adversarial conditions.\n  Communication is decoupled from the hierarchy and may use multi-frequency wireless links. Two message hop strategies are supported: (i) with long-distance infrastructure-assisted channels, coordinators exploit the virtual tree to minimize hops; (ii) without such channels, messages propagate via adjacent regions.\n  sVIRGO also supports Layer-Scoped Command Execution. Commands and coordination actions are executed within the scope of each hierarchical layer, enabling efficient local and regional decision-making while limiting unnecessary global propagation.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "challenges": "Challenges extraction failed", "contributions": "Contributions extraction failed", "results": "Results analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed", "related_work": "Related work extraction failed"}}
