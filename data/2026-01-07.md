Abstract: As quantum systems scale, Multiprogramming Quantum Computing (MPQC) becomes essential to improve device utilization and throughput. However, current MPQC pipelines rely on expensive online compilation to co-optimize concurrently running programs, because quantum executables are device-dependent, non-portable across qubit regions, and highly susceptible to noise and crosstalk. This online step dominates runtime and impedes low-latency deployments for practical, real-world workloads in the future, such as repeatedly invoked Quantum Neural Network (QNN) services.
  We present FLAMENCO, a fidelity-aware multi-version compilation system that enables independent offline compilation and low-latency, high-fidelity multiprogramming at runtime. At the architecture level, FLAMENCO abstracts devices into compute units to drastically shrink the search space of region allocation. At compile time, it generates diverse executable versions for each program -- each bound to a distinct qubit region -- allowing dynamic region selection at runtime and overcoming non-portability. At runtime, FLAMENCO employs a streamlined orchestrator that leverages post-compilation fidelity metrics to avoid conflicts and mitigate crosstalk, achieving reliable co-execution without online co-optimization. Comprehensive evaluations against state-of-the-art MPQC baselines show that FLAMENCO removes online compilation overhead, achieves over 5$\times$ runtime speedup, improves execution fidelity, and maintains high utilization as concurrency increases.

Abstract: Hardware event counters offer the potential to reveal not only performance bottlenecks but also detailed microarchitectural behavior. In practice, this promise is undermined by their vague specifications, opaque designs, and multiplexing noise, making event counter data hard to interpret.
  We introduce CounterPoint, a framework that tests user-specified microarchitectural models - expressed as $μ$path Decision Diagrams - for consistency with performance counter data. When mismatches occur, CounterPoint pinpoints plausible microarchitectural features that could explain them, using multi-dimensional counter confidence regions to mitigate multiplexing noise. We apply CounterPoint to the Haswell Memory Management Unit as a case study, shedding light on multiple undocumented and underdocumented microarchitectural behaviors. These include a load-store queue-side TLB prefetcher, merging page table walkers, abortable page table walks, and more.
  Overall, CounterPoint helps experts reconcile noisy hardware performance counter measurements with their mental model of the microarchitecture - uncovering subtle, previously hidden hardware features along the way.

Abstract: Microcontrollers are increasingly present in embedded deployments and dependable applications, for which malfunctions due to hardware ageing can have severe impact. The lack of deployable techniques for ageing monitoring on these devices has spread the application of guard bands to prevent timing errors due to degradation. Applying this static technique can limit performance and lead to sudden failures as devices age. In this paper, we follow a software-based self-testing approach to design monitoring of hardware degradation for microcontrollers. Deployable in the field, our technique leverages timing windows of variable lengths to determine the maximum operational frequency of the devices. We empirically validate the method on real hardware and find that it consistently detects temperature-induced degradations in maximum operating frequency of up to 13.79 % across devices for 60 °C temperature increase.

Abstract: RWKV is a modern RNN architecture that approaches the performance of Transformers, with the advantage of processing long contexts at a linear memory cost. However, its sequential computation pattern struggles to efficiently leverage GPU parallelism, which leads to low compute resource utilization. Furthermore, frequent off-chip weight accesses create a memory bottleneck. To address these challenges, we propose HFRWKV, an FPGA-based hardware accelerator specifically designed for RWKV. Within the matrix operation module, we propose a novel hardware-friendly hybrid-precision quantization strategy, which enhances performance while maintaining acceptable accuracy. For the complex operations including exponentiation and division, we introduce a method featuring reusable architectures combined with lookup tables or piecewise linear approximation, which is algorithmically refined to effectively balance precision and hardware resource consumption. Based on this foundation, we adopt a fully on-chip computing system integrating parallel matrix-vector processing array and an efficient pipeline architecture. Through computation reordering and chunked double buffering, it effectively eliminates data transfer bottlenecks and improves overall throughput. We implement HFRWKV on the Alveo U50 and U280 platform. Experimental results show that compared to a CPU, a throughput improvement of 63.48$\times$ and an energy efficiency improvement of 139.17$\times$. Compared to GPUs, achieves a throughput improvement of 32.33$\times$ and an energy efficiency improvement of 171.36$\times$.

Abstract: The MIT/IEEE/Amazon Graph Challenge provides a venue for individuals and teams to showcase new innovations in large-scale graph and sparse data analysis. The Anonymized Network Sensing Graph Challenge processes over 100 billion network packets to construct privacy-preserving traffic matrices, with a GraphBLAS reference implementation demonstrating how hypersparse matrices can be applied to this problem. This work presents a refactoring and benchmarking of a section of the reference code to improve clarity, adaptability, and performance. The original Python implementation spanning approximately 1000 lines across 3 files has been streamlined to 325 lines across two focused modules, achieving a 67% reduction in code size while maintaining full functionality. Using pMatlab and pPython distributed array programming libraries, the addition of parallel maps allowed for parallel benchmarking of the data. Scalable performance is demonstrated for large-scale summation and analysis of traffic matrices. The resulting implementation increases the potential impact of the Graph Challenge by providing a clear and efficient foundation for participants.

Abstract: In Compute-First Networking (CFN), an Access Point (AP) makes task offloading decisions based on resource state information reported by a Service Node (SN). A fundamental challenge arises from the trade-off between update overhead and decision accuracy: Frequent state updates consume limited network resources, while infrequent updates lead to stale state views and degraded task performance, especially under high system load. Existing approaches based on periodic updates or Age of Information (AoI) mainly focus on temporal freshness and often overlook whether a state change is actually relevant to offloading decisions. This paper proposes SenseCFN, a decision-aware state synchronization framework for CFN. Instead of synchronizing raw resource states, SenseCFN focuses on identifying state changes that are likely to alter offloading decisions. To this end, we introduce a lightweight semantic state representation that captures decision-relevant system characteristics, along with a Semantic Deviation Index (SDI) to quantify the impact of state shifts on decision outcomes. Based on SDI, the SN triggers updates only when significant decision-impacting changes are detected. Meanwhile, the AP performs offloading decisions using cached semantic states with explicit awareness of potential staleness. The update and offloading policies are jointly optimized using a centralized training with distributed execution (CTDE) approach. Simulation results show that SenseCFN maintains a task success rate of up to 99.6% in saturation-prone scenarios, outperforming baseline methods by more than 25%, while reducing status update frequency by approximately 70% to 96%. These results indicate that decision-aware state synchronization provides an effective and practical alternative to purely time-based update strategies in CFN.

Abstract: We consider the problem of maximizing utility in wireless backhaul networks, where utility is a function of satisfied service level agreements (SLAs), defined in terms of end-to-end packet delays and instantaneous throughput. We model backhaul networks as a tree topology and show that SLAs can be satisfied by constructing link schedules with bounded inter-scheduling times, an NP-complete problem known as pinwheel scheduling. For symmetric tree topologies, we show that simple round-robin schedules can be optimal under certain conditions. In the general case, we develop a mixed-integer program that optimizes over the set of admission decisions and pinwheel schedules. We develop a novel pinwheel scheduling algorithm, which significantly expands the set of schedules that can be found in polynomial time over the state of the art. Using conditions from this algorithm, we develop a scalable, distributed approach to solve the utility-maximization problem, with complexity that is linear in the depth of the tree.

Abstract: Modern 5G communication systems implement a combination of error correction and feedback-based erasure correction (HARQ/ARQ) as reliability mechanisms, which can introduce substantial delay and resource inefficiency. We propose forward erasure correction using network coding as a more delay-efficient alternative. We present a mathematical characterization of network delay for existing reliability mechanisms and network coding. Through simulations in a network slicing environment, we demonstrate that network coding not only improves the in-order delivery delay and goodput for the applications utilizing the slice, but also benefits other applications sharing the network by reducing resource utilization for the coded slice. Our analysis and characterization point towards ideas that require attention in the 6G standardization process. These findings highlight the need for greater modularity in protocol stack design that enables the integration of novel technologies in future wireless networks.

Abstract: This paper investigates a coordinated multi-cell integrated sensing, communication, and powering (ISCAP) system operating in the electromagnetic near field, where each base station (BS) employs an extremely large-scale antenna array (ELAA) to simultaneously support downlink communication, wireless power transfer (WPT), and environmental sensing. Three categories of communication users (CUs) with different interference cancellation capabilities are considered, and sensing is enabled through a distributed multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar architecture. To address the resulting design challenges, a robust optimization framework is proposed by optimizing the beamforming strategy to maximize the worst-case detection probability over a prescribed sensing region, subject to per-user signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraints and energy harvesting requirements at energy receivers (ERs), while explicitly capturing the uncertainty in ER locations. By leveraging semidefinite relaxation (SDR), the original non-convex problem is reformulated as a convex semidefinite program with a provably tight relaxation. Furthermore, a low-complexity maximum ratio transmission (MRT)-based suboptimal scheme is developed, yielding a closed-form solution in the asymptotic regime as the number of antenna elements approaches infinity. Extensive numerical results reveal the fundamental trade-offs among sensing accuracy, communication reliability, and WPT efficiency.

Abstract: The Internet of Agents is propelling edge computing toward agentic AI and edge general intelligence (EGI). However, deploying multi-agent service (MAS) on resource-constrained edge infrastructure presents severe challenges. MAS service workflows are driven by complex cross-node interactions, dynamic memory accumulation, and collaborative tool usage. Exhibiting chain-like topological dependencies and strict affinity constraints, these workflows demand real-time responsiveness that exceeds the capabilities of traditional VNE algorithms designed for static resources. To address this, we propose AgentVNE, a cloud-edge collaborative framework utilizing a dual-layer architecture. First, AgentVNE employs a large language model (LLM) to identify implicit semantic constraints and generate affinity-based resource augmentation to resolve physical dependency issues. Second, it constructs a resource similarity-aware neural network, utilizing a pre-training and PPO fine-tuning strategy to precisely capture topological similarities between dynamic workflows and heterogeneous networks. By coupling semantic perception with topological reasoning, this mechanism effectively bridges the gap between dynamic service requirements and physical infrastructure. Simulation results demonstrate that AgentVNE reduces workflow communication latency to less than 40% of baselines and improves the service acceptance rate by approximately 5%-10% under high-load scenarios. Ultimately, this work provides a foundational solution for the semantic-aware deployment of agentic AI.

Abstract: The growing performance demands and higher deployment densities of next-generation wireless systems emphasize the importance of adopting strategies to manage the energy efficiency of mobile networks. In this demo, we showcase a framework that enables research on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) techniques for improving the energy efficiency of intelligent and programmable Open Radio Access Network (RAN) systems. Using the open-source simulator ns-O-RAN and the reinforcement learning environment Gymnasium, the framework enables to train and evaluate DRL agents that dynamically control the activation and deactivation of cells in a 5G network. We show how to collect data for training and evaluate the impact of DRL on energy efficiency in a realistic 5G network scenario, including users' mobility and handovers, a full protocol stack, and 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP)-compliant channel models. The tool will be open-sourced and a tutorial for energy efficiency testing in ns-O-RAN.

Abstract: We develop an integrated Multi-Port Concurrent Communication Divisible Load Theory (MPCC-DLT) framework for relay-centric distributed satellite systems (DSS), capturing concurrent data dissemination, parallel computation, and result return under heterogeneous onboard processing and inter-satellite link conditions. We propose a formulation that yields closed-form expressions for optimal load allocation and completion time that explicitly quantify the joint impact of computation speed, link bandwidth, and result-size overhead. We further derive deadline feasibility conditions that enable explicit sizing of cooperative satellite clusters to meet time-critical task requirements. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that highly distributable tasks achieve substantial latency reduction, while communication-heavy tasks exhibit diminishing returns due to result-transfer overheads. To bridge theory and practice, we extend the MPCC-DLT framework with a real-time admission control mechanism that handles stochastic task arrivals and deadline constraints, enabling blocking-aware operation. Our real-time simulations illustrate how task structure and system parameters jointly govern deadline satisfaction and operating regimes. Overall, this work provides the first analytically tractable MPCC-DLT model for distributed satellite systems and offers actionable insights for application-aware scheduling and system-level design of future satellite constellations.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of IoT applications has intensified the demand for efficient and secure service placement in Fog computing. However, heterogeneous resources, dynamic workloads, and diverse security requirements make optimal service placement highly challenging. Most solutions focus primarily on performance metrics while overlooking the security implications of deployment decisions. This paper proposes a Security and Performance-Aware Distributed Deep Reinforcement Learning (SPA-DDRL) framework for joint optimization of service response time and security compliance in Fog computing. The problem is formulated as a weighted multi-objective optimization task, minimizing latency while maximizing a security score derived from the security capabilities of Fog nodes. The security score features a new three-tier hierarchy, where configuration-level checks verify proper settings, capability-level assessments evaluate the resource security features, and control-level evaluations enforce stringent policies, thereby ensuring compliant solutions that align with performance objectives. SPA-DDRL adopts a distributed broker-learner architecture where multiple brokers perform autonomous service-placement decisions and a centralized learner coordinates global policy optimization through shared prioritized experiences. It integrates three key improvements, including Long Short-Term Memory networks, Prioritized Experience Replay, and off-policy correction mechanisms to improve the agent's performance. Experiments based on real IoT workloads show that SPA-DDRL significantly improves both service response time and placement security compared to current approaches, achieving a 16.3% improvement in response time and a 33% faster convergence rate. It also maintains consistent, feasible, security-compliant solutions across all system scales, while baseline techniques fail or show performance degradation.

Abstract: Post-training with reinforcement learning (RL) has greatly enhanced the capabilities of large language models. Disaggregating the generation and training stages in RL into a parallel, asynchronous pipeline offers the potential for flexible scaling and improved throughput. However, it still faces two critical challenges. First, the generation stage often becomes a bottleneck due to dynamic workload shifts and severe execution imbalances. Second, the decoupled stages result in diverse and dynamic network traffic patterns that overwhelm conventional network fabrics. This paper introduces OrchestrRL, an orchestration framework that dynamically manages compute and network rhythms in disaggregated RL. To improve generation efficiency, OrchestrRL employs an adaptive compute scheduler that dynamically adjusts parallelism to match workload characteristics within and across generation steps. This accelerates execution while continuously rebalancing requests to mitigate stragglers. To address the dynamic network demands inherent in disaggregated RL -- further intensified by parallelism switching -- we co-design RFabric, a reconfigurable hybrid optical-electrical fabric. RFabric leverages optical circuit switches at selected network tiers to reconfigure the topology in real time, enabling workload-aware circuits for (i) layer-wise collective communication during training iterations, (ii) generation under different parallelism configurations, and (iii) periodic inter-cluster weight synchronization. We evaluate OrchestrRL on a physical testbed with 48 H800 GPUs, demonstrating up to a 1.40x throughput improvement. Furthermore, we develop RLSim, a high-fidelity simulator, to evaluate RFabric at scale. Our results show that RFabric achieves superior performance-cost efficiency compared to static Fat-Tree networks, establishing it as a highly effective solution for large-scale RL workloads.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models are increasingly used to serve LLMs at scale, but failures become common as deployment scale grows. Existing systems exhibit poor failure resilience: even a single worker failure triggers a coarse-grained, service-wide restart, discarding accumulated progress and halting the entire inference pipeline during recovery--an approach clearly ill-suited for latency-sensitive, LLM services.
  We present Tarragon, a resilient MoE inference framework that confines the failures impact to individual workers while allowing the rest of the pipeline to continue making forward progress. Tarragon exploits the natural separation between the attention and expert computation in MoE-based transformers, treating attention workers (AWs) and expert workers (EWs) as distinct failure domains. Tarragon introduces a reconfigurable datapath to mask failures by rerouting requests to healthy workers. On top of this datapath, Tarragon implements a self-healing mechanism that relaxes the tightly synchronized execution of existing MoE frameworks. For stateful AWs, Tarragon performs asynchronous, incremental KV cache checkpointing with per-request restoration, and for stateless EWs, it leverages residual GPU memory to deploy shadow experts. These together keep recovery cost and recomputation overhead extremely low. Our evaluation shows that, compared to state-of-the-art MegaScale-Infer, Tarragon reduces failure-induced stalls by 160-213x (from ~64 s down to 0.3-0.4 s) while preserving performance when no failures occur.

Abstract: Generative foundation models have become an important tool for data reconstruction and simulation in scientific computing, showing a tight integration with traditional numerical simulations. At the same time, with the development of new hardware features, such as matrix acceleration units and high-bandwidth memory, CPU-based clusters offer promising opportunities to accelerate and scale such models, facilitating the unification of artificial intelligence and scientific computing. We present DiT-HC, the first system to train and scale the generative model DiT on a next-generation HPC CPU cluster. DiT-HC introduces three key techniques: (1) communication-free tensor parallelism (CFTP) with AutoMem for automated memory-aware dataflow, (2) HCOps, a suite of optimized GEMM and operator kernels leveraging vector and matrix acceleration units, and (3) a custom MPI backend that overlaps computation, communication, and memory movement. Experiments show 8.2 to 87.7 times speedups over native or public CPU libraries and 90.6% weak scaling efficiency on 256 nodes. These results demonstrate the feasibility of large-scale generative model training on CPU clusters and provide new insights for future HPC-AI co-design.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel technique to preserve spectral features in lossy compression based on a novel fast Fourier correction algorithm\added{ for regular-grid data}. Preserving both spatial and frequency representations of data is crucial for applications such as cosmology, turbulent combustion, and X-ray diffraction, where spatial and frequency views provide complementary scientific insights. In particular, many analysis tasks rely on frequency-domain representations to capture key features, including the power spectrum of cosmology simulations, the turbulent energy spectrum in combustion, and diffraction patterns in reciprocal space for ptychography. However, existing compression methods guarantee accuracy only in the spatial domain while disregarding the frequency domain. To address this limitation, we propose an algorithm that corrects the errors produced by off-the-shelf ``base'' compressors such as SZ3, ZFP, and SPERR, thereby preserving both spatial and frequency representations by bounding errors in both domains. By expressing frequency-domain errors as linear combinations of spatial-domain errors, we derive a region that jointly bounds errors in both domains. Given as input the spatial errors from a base compressor and user-defined error bounds in the spatial and frequency domains, we iteratively project the spatial error vector onto the regions defined by the spatial and frequency constraints until it lies within their intersection. We further accelerate the algorithm using GPU parallelism to achieve practical performance. We validate our approach with datasets from cosmology simulations, X-ray diffraction, combustion simulation, and electroencephalography demonstrating its effectiveness in preserving critical scientific information in both spatial and frequency domains.

Abstract: Real-time recommender systems execute multi-stage cascades (retrieval, pre-processing, fine-grained ranking) under strict tail-latency SLOs, leaving only tens of milliseconds for ranking. Generative recommendation (GR) models can improve quality by consuming long user-behavior sequences, but in production their online sequence length is tightly capped by the ranking-stage P99 budget. We observe that the majority of GR tokens encode user behaviors that are independent of the item candidates, suggesting an opportunity to pre-infer a user-behavior prefix once and reuse it during ranking rather than recomputing it on the critical path. Realizing this idea at industrial scale is non-trivial: the prefix cache must survive across multiple pipeline stages before the final ranking instance is determined, the user population implies cache footprints far beyond a single device, and indiscriminate pre-inference would overload shared resources under high QPS. We present RelayGR, a production system that enables in-HBM relay-race inference for GR. RelayGR selectively pre-infers long-term user prefixes, keeps their KV caches resident in HBM over the request lifecycle, and ensures the subsequent ranking can consume them without remote fetches. RelayGR combines three techniques: 1) a sequence-aware trigger that admits only at-risk requests under a bounded cache footprint and pre-inference load, 2) an affinity-aware router that co-locates cache production and consumption by routing both the auxiliary pre-infer signal and the ranking request to the same instance, and 3) a memory-aware expander that uses server-local DRAM to capture short-term cross-request reuse while avoiding redundant reloads. We implement RelayGR on Huawei Ascend NPUs and evaluate it with real queries. Under a fixed P99 SLO, RelayGR supports up to 1.5$\times$ longer sequences and improves SLO-compliant throughput by up to 3.6$\times$.

Abstract: Lossy compression, widely used by scientists to reduce data from simulations, experiments, and observations, can distort features of interest even under bounded error. Such distortions may compromise downstream analyses and lead to incorrect scientific conclusions in applications such as combustion and cosmology. This paper presents a distributed and parallel algorithm for correcting topological features, specifically, piecewise linear Morse Smale segmentations (PLMSS), which decompose the domain into monotone regions labeled by their corresponding local minima and maxima. While a single GPU algorithm (MSz) exists for PLMSS correction after compression, no methodology has been developed that scales beyond a single GPU for extreme scale data. We identify the key bottleneck in scaling PLMSS correction as the parallel computation of integral paths, a communication-intensive computation that is notoriously difficult to scale. Instead of explicitly computing and correcting integral paths, our algorithm simplifies MSz by preserving steepest ascending and descending directions across all locations, thereby minimizing interprocess communication while introducing negligible additional storage overhead. With this simplified algorithm and relaxed synchronization, our method achieves over 90% parallel efficiency on 128 GPUs on the Perlmutter supercomputer for real world datasets.

Abstract: The Square Kilometre Array (SKA) will generate unprecedented data volumes, making efficient data processing a critical challenge. Within this context, the SKA Regional Centres Network (SRCNet) must operate in a near-exascale environment where traditional data-centric computing models based on moving large datasets to centralised resources are no longer viable due to network and storage bottlenecks.
  To address this limitation, this work proposes a shift towards distributed and in-situ computing, where computation is moved closer to the data. We explore the integration of Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) with an intelligent decision-making entity based on Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) to optimise data-intensive workflows within SRCNet. FaaS enables lightweight and modular function execution near data sources while abstracting infrastructure management.
  The proposed decision-making entity employs Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs) to explore near-optimal execution plans considering execution time and energy consumption, together with constraints related to data location and transfer costs. This work establishes a baseline framework for efficient and cost-aware computation-to-data strategies within the SRCNet architecture.

Abstract: SplitFed Learning (SFL) combines federated learning and split learning to enable collaborative training across distributed edge devices; however, it faces significant challenges in heterogeneous environments with diverse computational and communication capabilities. This paper proposes \textit{SuperSFL}, a federated split learning framework that leverages a weight-sharing super-network to dynamically generate resource-aware client-specific subnetworks, effectively mitigating device heterogeneity. SuperSFL introduces Three-Phase Gradient Fusion (TPGF), an optimization mechanism that coordinates local updates, server-side computation, and gradient fusion to accelerate convergence. In addition, a fault-tolerant client-side classifier and collaborative client--server aggregation enable uninterrupted training under intermittent communication failures. Experimental results on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 with up to 100 heterogeneous clients show that SuperSFL converges $2$--$5\times$ faster in terms of communication rounds than baseline SFL while achieving higher accuracy, resulting in up to $20\times$ lower total communication cost and $13\times$ shorter training time. SuperSFL also demonstrates improved energy efficiency compared to baseline methods, making it a practical solution for federated learning in heterogeneous edge environments.

Abstract: With growing urbanization worldwide, efficient management of traffic infrastructure is critical for transportation agencies and city planners. It is essential to have tools that help analyze large volumes of stored traffic data and make effective interventions. To address this need, we present ``BigSUMO", an end-to-end, scalable, open-source framework for analytics, interruption detection, and parallel traffic simulation. Our system ingests high-resolution loop detector and signal state data, along with sparse probe trajectory data. It first performs descriptive analytics and detects potential interruptions. It then uses the SUMO microsimulator for prescriptive analytics, testing hundreds of what-if scenarios to optimize traffic performance. The modular design allows integration of different algorithms for data processing and outlier detection. Built using open-source software and libraries, the pipeline is cost-effective, scalable, and easy to deploy. We hope BigSUMO will be a valuable aid in developing smart city mobility solutions.

Abstract: Training large language models requires distributing computation across many accelerators, yet practitioners select parallelism strategies (data, tensor, pipeline, ZeRO) through trial and error because no unified systematic framework predicts their behavior. We introduce placement semantics: each strategy is specified by how it places four training states (parameters, optimizer, gradients, activations) across devices using five modes (replicated, sharded, sharded-with-gather, materialized, offloaded). From placement alone, without implementation details, we derive memory consumption and communication volume. Our predictions match published results exactly: ZeRO-3 uses 8x less memory than data parallelism at 1.5x communication cost, as reported in the original paper. We prove two conditions (gradient integrity, state consistency) are necessary and sufficient for distributed training to match single-device results, and provide composition rules for combining strategies safely. The framework unifies ZeRO Stages 1-3, Fully Sharded Data Parallel (FSDP), tensor parallelism, and pipeline parallelism as instances with different placement choices.
