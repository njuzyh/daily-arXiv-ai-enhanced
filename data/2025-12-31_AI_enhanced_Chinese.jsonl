To ensure network scalability, user-centric clustering (UCC) has emerged as a practical approach, wherein only a selected subset of preferred APs jointly serves each UE. Forming the optimal cluster of APs for each UE is a challenging task, particularly when limited fronthaul and processing capabilities of both APs and UEs are considered. This challenge is exacerbated by the need for dynamic adjustments to enhance energy efficiency while meeting quality of service (QoS) requirements, which introduces conflicting interests between these entities. In this paper, we investigate the sociality regime of UEs and their clusters of APs, characterizing their intra-team cooperation as either selfish, egalitarian, or altruistic. These sociality regimes are crucial in achieving a balance between QoS and energy efficiency per UE. We address this problem by modeling it as a many-to-many social matching game with externalities, where connections can be established based on the sociality regime of both teams. To solve this, we introduce two novel algorithms based on Deferred Acceptance (DA) and Early Acceptance (EA) matching games. Numerical results show the significant impact of the sociality regime adopted by UEs and their clusters of APs on UE's QoS satisfaction and energy efficiency, with the egalitarian regime adopted by both entities proving the best performance trade-off.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "challenges": "Challenges extraction failed", "contributions": "Contributions extraction failed", "results": "Results analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed", "related_work": "Related work extraction failed"}}

The current elderly care system faces significant challenges, including insufficient long-term care resources and poor communication between healthcare providers. To address this limitation, this study introduces a novel Starlink-assisted IOMT-based elderly healthcare model designed to improve remote patient monitoring and communication reliability. This proposal system focused on a monitoring system of key biomedical parameters such as electrocardiogram (ECG), body temperature, heart attack indicators, and a fall detection alert system. Performance is evaluated using the network simulator (NS-3) to assess its effectiveness in remote and underserved regions. Physiological data collected from patients are transmitted through a local communication hub and forwarded over a Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite link to a medical center.

Addressing this, we defines a future-oriented user sovereignty interaction paradigm, aiming to realize a fundamental shift from killing time to saving time. Specifically, we argue that decoupling memory from application logic eliminates the structural basis of data lock-in, while shifting from explicit manual instruction to implicit intent alignment resolves cognitive overload by offloading execution complexity. This paradigm is implemented via the Sovereign Digital Avatar (SoDA), which employs an orthogonal decoupling design of storage, computation, and interaction. This establishes the architectural principle of data as a persistent asset, model as a transient tool, fundamentally breaking the platform monopoly on user memory. To support the operation of this new paradigm in zero-trust environments, we design an Intent-Permission Handshake Mechanism based on A2A protocols, utilizing dual-factor (Sensitivity Coefficient and Strictness Parameter) adaptive routing to achieve active risk governance. Empirical evaluation with a high-fidelity simulation environment indicates that this paradigm reduces token consumption by approximately 27-35\\% during cross-platform service migration and complex task execution.

OptiNIC eliminates retransmissions and in-order delivery from the NIC, enabling a best-effort, out-of-order transport model for RDMA.

Our approach dynamically allocates GPU resources based on workload characteristics, agent priorities, and minimum resource requirements, enabling efficient utilization while maintaining quality of service. The framework addresses three key challenges: (1) heterogeneous computational demands across lightweight coordinators and heavyweight specialists, (2) dynamic workload fluctuations requiring millisecond-scale reallocation, and (3) capacity constraints in serverless environments.

They do so by organizing computation around explicit, compiler-managed data movement over the on-chip network, allowing operands to be directly forwarded between processing elements and reducing reliance on high-latency, bandwidth-limited global shared memory. Such localized communications can provide higher throughput and efficiency compared to repeated off-chip memory accesses. However, their end-to-end performance depends strongly on how workloads are mapped to the hardware. Naive mappings can perform very poorly, and most users rely on hand-tuned vendor libraries. In practice, although existing spatial-dataflow accelerators have strong potential for high performance, energy- and cost-efficiency, their limited programmability remains a major barrier to their wider adoption. This paper presents TL, an end-to-end framework that compiles tile-based programs (such as Triton kernels) onto spatial dataflow architectures. Unlike most existing compiler frameworks that focus on optimizing code generation within a single tile, TL addresses the central challenge of distributing tile instances across spatially distributed cores and exploiting the on-chip network and distributed memories to increase data reuse and reduce communications. TL proposes a hardware representation that captures interconnect topology, memory hierarchy, and compute capabilities, enabling both specialized architecture-specific optimizations and support for diverse spatial dataflow targets.

Localizing these corruptions is essential: without identifying the affected region, it is impossible to diagnose the source of degradation, apply targeted corrective measures, or restore model functionality without resorting to costly fine-tuning or full retraining. This work introduces BitFlipScope, a scalable, software-based framework for identifying fault-affected regions within transformer architectures under two deployment scenarios. When a clean reference model is available, BitFlipScope performs differential analysis of outputs, hidden states, and internal activations for detecting anomalous behavior indicative of corruption to pinpoint or localize faults. When no reference model exists, it uses residual-path perturbation and loss-sensitivity profiling to infer the fault-impacted region directly from the corrupted model. In both settings, the framework not only enables effective fault diagnosis but also supports lightweight performance recovery without fine-tuning, offering a practical path to restoring corrupted models.

When processing long inputs in RAG, the prefill phase of computing the key-value vectors of input text is energy-intensive and time-consuming even with high-end GPUs. Thus, it is crucial to make the prefill phase in RAG inference efficient. To address this issue, we propose MatKV, a scheme that precomputes the key-value vectors (KVs) of RAG objects (e.g., documents), materializes them in inexpensive but fast and power-efficient flash storage, and reuses them at inference time instead of recomputing the KVs using costly and power-inefficient GPU. Experimental results using Hugging Face's Transformers library across state-of-the-art GPUs and flash memory SSDs confirm that, compared to full KV computation on GPUs, MatKV reduces both inference time and power consumption by half for RAG workloads, without severely impacting accuracy in the question-answering task. Furthermore, we demonstrate that MatKV enables additional optimizations in two ways. First, a GPU can decode text while simultaneously loading the materialized KVs for the next instance, reducing load latency. Second, since decoding speed is less sensitive to GPU performance than KV computation, low-end GPUs can be leveraged for decoding without significantly compromising speed once the materialized KVs are loaded into GPU memory.
