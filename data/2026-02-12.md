Abstract: A growing class of applications depends on fair ordering, where events that occur earlier should be processed before later ones. Providing such guarantees is difficult in practice because clock synchronization is inherently imperfect: events generated at different clients within a short time window may carry timestamps that cannot be reliably ordered. Rather than attempting to eliminate synchronization error, we embrace it and establish a probabilistically fair sequencing process. Tommy is a sequencer that uses a statistical model of per-clock synchronization error to compare noisy timestamps probabilistically. Although this enables ordering of two events, the probabilistic comparator is intransitive, making global ordering non-trivial. We address this challenge by mapping the sequencing problem to a classical ranking problem from social choice theory, which offers principled mechanisms for reasoning with intransitive comparisons. Using this formulation, Tommy produces a partial order of events, achieving significantly better fairness than a Spanner TrueTime-based baseline approach.

Abstract: As chip-to-chip silicon photonics gain traction for their bandwidth and energy efficiency, their circuit-switched nature raises a fundamental question for collective communication: when and how should the interconnect be reconfigured to realize these benefits? Establishing direct optical paths can reduce congestion and propagation delay, but each reconfiguration incurs non-negligible overhead, making naive per-step reconfiguration impractical.
  We present Harvest, a systematic approach for synthesizing topology reconfiguration schedules that minimize collective completion time in photonic interconnects. Given a collective communication algorithm and its fixed communication schedule, Harvest determines how the interconnect should evolve over the course of the collective, explicitly balancing reconfiguration delay against congestion and propagation delay. We reduce the synthesis problem into a dynamic program with an underlying topology optimization subproblem and show that the approach applies to arbitrary collective communication algorithms. Furthermore, we exploit the algorithmic structure of a well-known AllReduce algorithm (Recursive Doubling) to synthesize optimal reconfiguration schedules without using any optimizers. By parameterizing the formulation using reconfiguration delay, Harvest naturally adapts to various photonic technologies. Using packet-level and flow-level evaluations, as well as hardware emulation on commercial GPUs, we show that the schedules synthesized by Harvest significantly reduce collective completion time across multiple collective algorithms compared to static interconnects and reconfigure-every-step baselines.

Abstract: L7 load balancers are a fundamental building block in microservices as they enable fine-grained traffic distribution. Compared to monolithic applications, microservices demand higher performance and stricter isolation from load balancers. This is due to the increased number of instances, longer service chains, and the necessity for co-location with services on the same host. Traditional sidecar-based load balancers are ill-equipped to meet these demands, often resulting in significant performance degradation.
  In this work, we present XLB, a novel architecture that reshapes L7 load balancers as in-kernel interposition operating on the socket layer. We leverage eBPF to implement the core load balancing logic in the kernel, and address the connection management and state maintenance challenges through novel socket layer redirection and nested eBPF maps designs. XLB eliminates the extra overhead of scheduling, communication, and data movement, resulting in a more lightweight, scalable, and efficient L7 load balancer architecture. Compared to the widely used microservices load balancers (Istio and Cilium), over 50 microservice instances, XLB achieves up to 1.5x higher throughput and 60% lower end-to-end latency.

Abstract: The interconnection of 5G and non-terrestrial networks (NTNs) has been actively studied to expand connectivity beyond conventional terrestrial infrastructure. In the 3GPP standardization of 5G systems, the 5G Quality of Service (QoS) Identifier (5QI) is defined to characterize the QoS requirements of different traffic requirements. However, it falls short in capturing the diverse latency, capacity, and reliability profiles of NTN environments, particularly when NTNs are used as backhaul. Furthermore, it is difficult to manage individual traffic flows and perform efficient resource allocation and routing when a large number of 5G traffic flows are present in NTN systems. To address these challenges, we propose an optimization framework that enhances QoS handling by introducing an NTN QoS Identifier (NQI) and grouping 5G traffic into NTN slices based on similar requirements. This enables unified resource control and routing for a large number of 5G flows in NTN systems. In this paper, we present the detailed procedure of the proposed framework, which consists of 5QI to NQI mapping, NTN traffic to NTN slice mapping, and slice-level flow and routing optimization. We evaluate the framework by comparing multiple mapping schemes through numerical simulations and analyze their impact on overall network performance.

Abstract: The agricultural industry has been searching for a high-speed successor to the 250~kbit/s CAN bus backbone of ISO~11783 (ISOBUS) for over a decade, yet no protocol-level solution has reached standardization. Meanwhile, modern planters, sprayers, and Virtual Terminals are already constrained by the bus bandwidth. This paper presents ISO FastLane, a gateway-less dual-stack approach that routes point-to-point ISOBUS traffic over Ethernet while keeping broadcast messages on the existing CAN bus. The solution requires no new state machines, no middleware, and no changes to application layer code: only a simple Layer~3 routing decision and a lightweight peer discovery mechanism called Augmented Address Claim (AACL). Legacy devices continue to operate unmodified and unaware of FastLane traffic. Preliminary tests reported on the paper demonstrate that ISO FastLane accelerates Virtual Terminal object pool uploads by factor of 8 and sustains Task Controller message rates over 100 times beyond the current specification limit. Because ISO FastLane builds entirely on existing J1939 and ISO~11783 conventions, it can be implemented by ISOBUS engineers in a matter of weeks. This is delivering tangible performance gains today, without waiting for the long-term High Speed ISOBUS solution.

Abstract: This paper studies orthogonal time-frequency space (OTFS) modulation aided multistatic integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) in vehicular networks, whereby its delay-Doppler robustness is exploited for enhanced communication and high-resolution sensing. We present a triangulation-based deployment framework combined with Kalman filtering (KF) that enables accurate target localization and velocity estimation. In addition, we assess the ISAC performance in the multistatic topology to determine its effectiveness in the dynamic environment. Further, a suboptimal placement strategy for the multistatic receivers is devised to reduce the targets' localization error. Numerical results demonstrate significant reductions in the sensing error and bit error rate (BER) performances.

Abstract: Sixth generation (6G) physical layer (PHY) is evolving beyond the legacy orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)-based waveforms. In this paper, we compare the bit error rate (BER) performance of three beyond-OFDM waveforms, namely, orthogonal time-frequency-space (OTFS) modulation, affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM), and orthogonal chirp division multiplexing (OCDM), which are particularly suitable for the highly mobile non-terrestrial network (NTN) vertical of 6G. In order to characterize the effect of mobility and Doppler shift in low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites, we performed BER comparisons over four different NTN tapped-delay-line (TDL) models, TDL-A, TDL-B, TDL-C, and TDL-D, as specified in the 3rd generation partnership project (3GPP) technical report TR 38.811. After channel equalization, a minimum mean squared error with successive detection (MMSE-SD) algorithm was used to enhance the BER performance. It was found that AFDM and OTFS consistently outperformed OCDM across all TDL models, while AFDM performed better than OTFS in TDL-B and TDL-C, in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime. The complete simulation framework is made available as an open-source code for quick validation and further development.

Abstract: The convergence of AI and 6G network automation introduces new challenges in maintaining transparency, fairness, and accountability across multivendor management systems. Although closed-loop AI orchestration improves adaptability and self-optimization, it also creates a responsibility gap, where violations of SLAs cannot be causally attributed to specific agents or vendors. This paper presents a hybrid responsible AI-stochastic learning framework that embeds fairness, robustness, and auditability directly into the network control loop. The framework integrates RAI games with stochastic optimization, enabling dynamic adversarial reweighting and probabilistic exploration across heterogeneous vendor domains. An RAAP continuously records AI-driven decision trajectories and produces dual accountability reports: user-level SLA summaries and operator-level responsibility analytics. Experimental evaluations on synthetic two-class multigroup datasets demonstrate that the proposed hybrid model improves the accuracy of the worst group by up to 10.5\%. Specifically, hybrid RAI achieved a WGAcc of 60.5\% and an AvgAcc of 72.7\%, outperforming traditional RAI-GA (50.0\%) and ERM (21.5\%). The audit mechanism successfully traced 99\% simulated SLA violations to the AI entities responsible, producing both vendor and agent-level accountability indices. These results confirm that the proposed hybrid approach enhances fairness and robustness as well as establishes a concrete accountability framework for autonomous SLA assurance in multivendor 6G networks.

Abstract: Network communication using the Internet Protocol (IP) is a pillar of modern Internet applications. IP allows data packets to travel the world through a complex set of interconnected computer networks managed by different operators. How IP-based data communication changes over time can be interesting from an end-system's perspective without relying on underlying network providers. This article presents an extensive, trace-driven analysis of user data traffic (covering five years of observations, six large Internet service providers (covering research, business and consumer category type), twenty autonomous systems, and fourteen countries.
  Our three primary findings are: i users data packet transmission paths are not deterministic and does not always select the geographically shortest path; ii) user packets take different routes that cover many countries and detour between two fixed points. Even after changing the types of Internet service provider type (e.g., from commercial to research), the routing can differ significantly between two locations. iii) Packet transmission delay can be influenced by changing the Internet service provider and IP protocol versions (i.e., from IPv4 to IPv6).

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-mounted Base Stations (UAV-BSs) offer a flexible solution for serving ground users in temporary hotspot scenarios. However, efficiently deploying UAV-BSs to satisfy heterogeneous user distributions remains a challenging optimization problem. While recent data-driven approaches, particularly Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), have shown promise in dynamic environments, they often suffer from prohibitive training overhead, poor generalization to topology changes, and high computational complexity. To address these limitations, this paper proposes Satisfaction-driven Coverage Optimization via Perimeter Extraction (SCOPE), a training-free and online 3D deployment framework. Unlike heuristic baselines that rely on fixed-altitude assumptions, SCOPE integrates a perimeter extraction mechanism with the Smallest Enclosing Circle (SEC) algorithm to dynamically optimize 3D UAV positions. Theoretically, we provide a rigorous convergence proof of the proposed algorithm and derive its polynomial time complexity of $O(N^2 \log N)$. Experimentally, we conduct a comprehensive comparative study against state-of-the-art DRL baselines (e.g., PPO). Simulation results demonstrate that SCOPE achieves comparable user satisfaction to DRL methods but significantly lower computational latency (milliseconds vs. hours of training) and superior energy efficiency, making it an ideal solution for real-time, on-demand emergency deployment.

Abstract: In the era of 6G Air-Ground Integrated Networks (AGINs), Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are pivotal for providing on-demand wireless coverage in mission-critical environments, such as post-disaster rescue operations. However, traditional Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) approaches for multi-UAV orchestration often face critical challenges: instability due to the non-stationarity of multi-agent environments and the difficulty of balancing energy efficiency with service equity. To address these issues, this paper proposes ORCHID (Orchestration of Resilient Coverage via Hybrid Intelligent Deployment), a novel stability-enhanced two-stage learning framework. First, ORCHID leverages a GBS-aware topology partitioning strategy to mitigate the exploration cold-start problem. Second, we introduce a Reset-and-Finetune (R\&F) mechanism within the MAPPO architecture that stabilizes the learning process via synchronized learning rate decay and optimizer state resetting. This mechanism effectively suppresses gradient variance to prevent policy degradation, thereby ensuring algorithmic resilience in dynamic environments. Furthermore, we uncover a counter-intuitive efficiency-fairness synergy: contrary to the conventional trade-off, our results demonstrate that the proposed Max-Min Fairness (MMF) design not only guarantees service for cell-edge users but also achieves superior energy efficiency compared to Proportional Fairness (PF), which tends to converge to suboptimal greedy equilibria. Extensive experiments confirm that ORCHID occupies a superior Pareto-dominant position compared to state-of-the-art baselines, ensuring robust convergence and resilient connectivity in mission-critical scenarios.

Abstract: In 3D Aerial-Ground Integrated Networks (AGINs), ensuring continuous service coverage under unexpected hardware failures is critical for mission-critical applications. While Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) has shown promise in autonomous coordination, its resilience under sudden node failures remains a challenge due to dynamic topology deformation. This paper proposes a Topology-Aware Graph MAPPO (TAG-MAPPO) framework designed to enhance system survivability through autonomous 3D spatial reconfiguration. Our framework incorporates graph-based feature aggregation with a residual ego-state fusion mechanism to capture intricate inter-agent dependencies. This architecture enables the surviving swarm to rapidly adapt its topology compared to conventional Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) based approaches. Extensive simulations across heterogeneous environments, ranging from interference-limited Crowded Urban to sparse Rural areas, validate the proposed approach. The results demonstrate that TAG-MAPPO consistently outperforms baselines in both stability and efficiency; specifically, it reduces redundant handoffs by up to 50 percent while maintaining a lead in energy efficiency. Most notably, the framework exhibits exceptional self-healing capabilities following a catastrophic node failure. TAG-MAPPO restores over 90 percent of the pre-failure service coverage within 15 time steps, exhibiting a significantly faster V-shaped recovery trajectory than MLP baselines. Furthermore, in dense urban scenarios, the framework achieves a post-failure Jain's Fairness Index that even surpasses its original four-UAV configuration by effectively resolving service overlaps. These findings suggest that topology-aware coordination is essential for the realization of resilient 6G aerial networks and provides a robust foundation for adaptive deployments in volatile environments.

Abstract: Post-quantum cryptography (PQC) is crucial for securing data against emerging quantum threats. However, its algorithms are computationally complex and difficult to implement efficiently on hardware. In this paper, we explore the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to accelerate the hardware-software co-design process for PQC, with a focus on the FALCON digital signature scheme. We present a novel framework that leverages LLMs to analyze PQC algorithms, identify performance-critical components, and generate candidate hardware descriptions for FPGA implementation. We present the first quantitative comparison between LLM-driven synthesis and conventional HLS-based approaches for low-level compute-intensive kernels in FALCON, showing that human-in-the-loop LLM-generated accelerators can achieve up to 2.6x speedup in kernel execution time with shorter critical paths, while highlighting trade-offs in resource utilization and power consumption. Our results suggest that LLMs can minimize design effort and development time by automating FPGA accelerator design iterations for PQC algorithms, offering a promising new direction for rapid and adaptive PQC accelerator design on FPGAs.

Abstract: Industrial domains such as automotive, robotics, and aerospace are rapidly evolving to satisfy the increasing demand for machine-learning-driven Autonomy, Connectivity, Electrification, and Shared mobility (ACES). This paradigm shift inherently and significantly increases the requirement for onboard computing performance and high-performance communication infrastructure. At the same time, Moore's Law and Dennard Scaling are grinding to a halt, in turn, driving computing systems to larger scales and higher levels of heterogeneity and specialization, through application-specific hardware accelerators, instead of relying on technological scaling only. Approaching ACES requires this substantial amount of compute at an increasingly high energy-efficiency, since most use cases are fundamentally resource-bound. This increase in compute performance and heterogeneity goes hand in hand with a growing demand for high memory bandwidth and capacity as the driving applications grow in complexity, operating on huge and progressively irregular data sets and further requiring a steady influx of sensor data, increasing pressure both on on-chip and off-chip interconnect systems. Further, ACES combines real-time time-critical with general compute tasks on the same physical platform, sharing communication, storage, and micro-architectural resources. These heterogeneous mixed-criticality systems (MCSs) place additional pressure on the interconnect, demanding minimal contention between the different criticality levels to sustain a high degree of predictability. Fulfilling the performance and energy-efficiency requirements across a wide range of industrial applications requires a carefully co-designed process of the memory system with the use cases as well as the compute units and accelerators.

Abstract: Processing large-scale graph datasets is computationally intensive and time-consuming. Processor-centric CPU and GPU architectures, commonly used for graph applications, often face bottlenecks caused by extensive data movement between the processor and memory units due to low data reuse. As a result, these applications are often memory-bound, limiting both performance and energy efficiency due to excessive data transfers. Processing-In-Memory (PIM) offers a promising approach to mitigate data movement bottlenecks by integrating computation directly within or near memory. Although several previous studies have introduced custom PIM proposals for graph processing, they do not leverage real-world PIM systems.
  This work aims to explore the capabilities and characteristics of common graph algorithms on a real-world PIM system to accelerate data-intensive graph workloads. To this end, we (1) implement representative graph algorithms on UPMEM's general-purpose PIM architecture; (2) characterize their performance and identify key bottlenecks; (3) compare results against CPU and GPU baselines; and (4) derive insights to guide future PIM hardware design.
  Our study underscores the importance of selecting optimal data partitioning strategies across PIM cores to maximize performance. Additionally, we identify critical hardware limitations in current PIM architectures and emphasize the need for future enhancements across computation, memory, and communication subsystems. Key opportunities for improvement include increasing instruction-level parallelism, developing improved DMA engines with non-blocking capabilities, and enabling direct interconnection networks among PIM cores to reduce data transfer overheads.

Abstract: Major challenges in LLMs inference remain frequent memory bandwidth bottlenecks, computational redundancy, and inefficiencies in long-sequence processing. To address these issues, we propose LLM-CoOpt, a comprehensive algorithmhardware co-design framework aimed at improving both throughput and latency in LLM inference. LLM-CoOpt integrates three key strategies: (1) Key-Value Cache Optimization, termed Opt-KV, which improves memory access efficiency by optimizing both KV cache write and read paths, and introduces FP8 quantization to reduce memory footprint while maintaining accuracy; (2) Grouped-Query Attention for Computational Efficiency, termed Opt-GQA, which reduces the overall computational complexity by restructuring multi-head self-attention into grouped-query attention with shared key-value projections, enabling higher throughput and lower resource consumption; (3) Paged Attention for Long- Sequence Processing, termed Opt-Pa, which adopts a two-step strategy to first segment long sequences into manageable chunks and then apply lazy memory mapping and computation, significantly reducing memory pressure and improving performance on long-context inputs.Experiments on the LLaMa-13BGPTQ model demonstrate that LLM-CoOpt increases inference throughput by up to 13.43%, reduces latency by up to 16.79%, and maintains model accuracy. These results confirm that LLM-CoOpt provides a practical, high-performance optimization path for real-world inference of large-scale language models.

Abstract: When is coordination intrinsically required by a distributed specification, rather than imposed by a particular protocol or implementation strategy? We give a general answer using minimal assumptions. In an asynchronous message-passing model, we show that a specification admits a coordination-free implementation if and only if it is monotone with respect to history extension under an appropriate order on observable outcomes.
  This Coordination Criterion is stated directly over Lamport histories -- partially ordered executions under happens-before -- and specification-defined observable outcomes, without assuming any particular programming language, object implementation, or protocol structure. It yields a sharp boundary between specifications that can be implemented without coordination and those for which coordination is unavoidable. The criterion provides a uniform explanation for a range of classical results, including CAP-style impossibility, CALM-style coordination-freedom, agreement and snapshot tasks, transactional isolation levels, and invariant confluence -- all instances of the same underlying semantic phenomenon.

Abstract: ARM SVE and RISC-V RVV are emerging vector architectures in high-end processors that support vectorization of flexible vector length. In this work, we leverage an important workload for quantum computing, quantum state-vector simulations, to understand whether high-performance portability can be achieved in a vector-length agnostic (VLA) design. We propose a VLA design and optimization techniques critical for achieving high performance, including VLEN-adaptive memory layout adjustment, load buffering, fine-grained loop control, and gate fusion-based arithmetic intensity adaptation. We provide an implementation in Google's Qsim and evaluate five quantum circuits of up to 36 qubits on three ARM processors, including NVIDIA Grace, AWS Graviton3, and Fujitsu A64FX. By defining new metrics and PMU events to quantify vectorization activities, we draw generic insights for future VLA designs. Our single-source implementation of VLA quantum simulations achieves up to 4.5x speedup on A64FX, 2.5x speedup on Grace, and 1.5x speedup on Graviton.

Abstract: Deploying large-scale MoE models presents challenges in memory capacity and bandwidth for expert activation. While Attention-FFN Disaggregation (AFD) has emerged as a potential architecture to decouple compute and memory resources, its performance boundaries compared to standard large-scale Expert Parallelism (EP) remain underexplored. In this paper, we conduct a systematic analysis of AFD by extending the roofline model to the communication level, correlating interconnect bandwidth, arithmetic intensity, and Hardware FLOPS Utilization (HFU). Our analysis reveals a dead zone on standard clusters: increasing FFN instance count fails to improve HFU as computational workload is capped by scale-out bandwidth, causing operator active time to shrink relative to the fixed latency budget. We further show that AFD's discrete node-level scaling incurs higher imbalance penalties than EP's continuous batch adjustment. Nevertheless, these limitations diminish under specific conditions: Superpod-class hardware with abundant interconnect bandwidth and models with coarse-grained experts and lower sparsity are more likely to benefit from AFD. These findings position AFD as a promising approach for specific hardware-model combinations rather than a universal solution.

Abstract: Remote KV cache reuse fetches KV cache for identical contexts from remote storage, avoiding recomputation, accelerating LLM inference. While it excels in high-speed networks, its performance degrades significantly in bandwidth-limited scenarios. Recent studies address this by transmitting KV caches in compressed form, but the associated heavyweight decompression counteracts the KV reuse benefits. In this paper, we propose an efficient and widely deployable remote KV cache reuse solution that leverages GPU-native video codecs. Our system, KVFetcher, enables effective KV cache coding with two techniques. The codec-friendly tensor layout compresses the KV cache in a highly compact video format, enabling fast transmission. The efficient KV fetcher orchestrates the transmission, decoding, and restoration of compressed KV caches in an efficient pipelined manner, eliminating resource contention, masking network fluctuations, and achieving minimum time-to-first-token (TTFT). We prototype KVFetcher on diverse GPUs from high- to low-end. Experiments reveal that it reduces TTFT by up to 3.51 times while maintaining lossless accuracy, compared to SOTA methods.
