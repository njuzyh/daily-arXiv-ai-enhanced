Abstract: Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) enables computation directly on encrypted data but incurs massive computational and memory overheads, often exceeding plaintext execution by several orders of magnitude. While custom ASIC accelerators can mitigate these costs, their long time-to-market and the rapid evolution of FHE algorithms threaten their long-term relevance. GPUs, by contrast, offer scalability, programmability, and widespread availability, making them an attractive platform for FHE. However, modern GPUs are increasingly specialized for machine learning workloads, emphasizing low-precision datatypes (e.g., INT$8$, FP$8$) that are fundamentally mismatched to the wide-precision modulo arithmetic required by FHE. Essentially, while GPUs offer ample parallelism, their functional units, like Tensor Cores, are not suited for wide-integer modulo arithmetic required by FHE schemes such as CKKS. Despite this constraint, researchers have attempted to map FHE primitives on Tensor Cores by segmenting wide integers into low-precision (INT$8$) chunks.
  To overcome these bottlenecks, we propose FHECore, a specialized functional unit integrated directly into the GPU's Streaming Multiprocessor. Our design is motivated by a key insight: the two dominant contributors to latency$-$Number Theoretic Transform and Base Conversion$-$can be formulated as modulo-linear transformations. This allows them to be mapped on a common hardware unit that natively supports wide-precision modulo-multiply-accumulate operations. Our simulations demonstrate that FHECore reduces dynamic instruction count by a geometric mean of $2.41\times$ for CKKS primitives and $1.96\times$ for end-to-end workloads. These reductions translate to performance speedups of $1.57\times$ and $2.12\times$, respectively$-$including a $50\%$ reduction in bootstrapping latency$-$all while inuring a modest $2.4\%$ area overhead.

Abstract: With the continuous growth of neural network scales, low-precision quantization is widely used in edge accelerators. Classic multi-threshold activation hardware requires 2^n thresholds for n-bit outputs, causing a rapid increase in hardware cost as precision increases. We propose a reconfigurable activation hardware, GRAU, based on piecewise linear fitting, where the segment slopes are approximated by powers of two. Our design requires only basic comparators and 1-bit right shifters, supporting mixed-precision quantization and nonlinear functions such as SiLU. Compared with multi-threshold activators, GRAU reduces LUT consumption by over 90%, achieving higher hardware efficiency, flexibility, and scalability.

Abstract: Neural network accelerators have been widely applied to edge devices for complex tasks like object tracking, image recognition, etc. Previous works have explored the quantization technologies in related lightweight accelerator designs to reduce hardware resource consumption. However, low precision leads to high accuracy loss in inference. Therefore, mixed-precision quantization becomes an alternative solution by applying different precision in different layers to trade off resource consumption and accuracy. Because regular designs for multiplication on hardware cannot support the precision reconfiguration for a multi-precision Quantized Neural Network (QNN) model in runtime, we propose a runtime reconfigurable multi-precision multi-channel bitwise systolic array design for QNN accelerators. We have implemented and evaluated our work on the Ultra96 FPGA platform. Results show that our work can achieve 1.3185 to 3.5671 times speedup in inferring mixed-precision models and has less critical path delay, supporting a higher clock frequency (250MHz).

Abstract: All-to-all GPU communication is a critical bottleneck in large-scale training clusters, where completion time is constrained by per-port bandwidth and can be severely impacted by traffic skew across GPUs and network interface cards (NICs). This issue is amplified by the two-tier structure of modern GPU systems, which combine fast intra-server links with much slower inter-server networks. Motivated by recent system observations that highlight the importance of traffic reshaping and hierarchy awareness, we study all-to-all scheduling from an online switching and queueing-theoretic perspective.
  We propose a dynamic hierarchical Birkhoff--von Neumann (BvN) decomposition framework tailored to two-tier GPU fabrics. At each frame boundary, traffic is first balanced within each server using simple local operations to mitigate micro-level GPU/NIC skew while preserving aggregate server-to-server demand. A hierarchical BvN decomposition is then applied at the server level and refined into GPU-level matchings, significantly reducing decomposition complexity relative to a flat GPU-level approach. By integrating this construction with the dynamic frame sizing (DFS) principle, we obtain an online scheduler with provable stability under admissible Poisson arrivals. Simulations demonstrate substantial reductions in mean frame length, particularly under server-localized hotspot traffic.

Abstract: This paper investigates the problem of minimizing total energy consumption for secure federated learning (FL) in wireless edge networks, a key paradigm for decentralized big data analytics. To tackle the high computational cost and privacy challenges of processing large-scale distributed data with conventional neural networks, we propose an FL with hyperdimensional computing and differential privacy (FL-HDC-DP) framework. Each edge device employs hyperdimensional computing (HDC) for lightweight local training and applies differential privacy (DP) noise to protect transmitted model updates. The total energy consumption is minimized through a joint optimization of the HDC dimension, transmit power, and CPU frequency. An efficient hybrid algorithm is developed, combining an outer enumeration search for HDC dimensions with an inner one-dimensional search for resource allocation. Simulation results show that the proposed framework achieves up to 83.3% energy reduction compared with baseline schemes, while maintaining high accuracy and faster convergence.

Abstract: We introduce the concept of engineered simultaneity: a system design that (1) requires comparing events at spacelike-separated locations, (2) implements this comparison via an implicit simultaneity convention, and (3) represents the result as objective rather than conventional. The United States National Best Bid and Offer (NBBO), mandated by SEC Regulation NMS Rule 611, is shown to be an instance of engineered simultaneity. We prove that the NBBO is frame-dependent: its value depends on the reference frame in which "current" prices are defined. Since the exchanges that generate quote data are separated by distances of 43-1,180 km, light-travel times of 143-3,940 microseconds create unavoidable windows during which no frame-independent price ordering exists. High-frequency trading firms exploit this window by accessing exchange data via direct feeds (latency ~tens of microseconds) while the consolidated Securities Information Processor operates at ~1,128 microseconds -- a ratio exceeding 50:1. We demonstrate that this constitutes a category mistake in the sense of Ryle: the NBBO applies the concept of "simultaneity" in a domain where it has no frame-independent meaning. The resulting information asymmetry extracts approximately $5 billion annually from other market participants.

Abstract: Enabling efficient, high-performance data access in parallel file systems (PFS) is critical for today's high-performance computing systems. PFS client-side I/O heavily impacts the final I/O performance delivered to individual applications and the entire system. Autotuning the key client-side I/O behaviors has been extensively studied and shows promising results. However, existing work has heavily relied on extensive number of global runtime metrics to monitor and accurate modeling of applications' I/O patterns. Such heavy overheads significantly limit the ability to enable fine-grained, dynamic tuning in practical systems. In this study, we propose DIAL (Decentralized I/O AutoTuning via Learned Client-side Local Metrics) which takes a drastically different approach. Instead of trying to extract the global I/O patterns of applications, DIAL takes a decentralized approach, treating each I/O client as an independent unit and tuning configurations using only its locally observable metrics. With the help of machine learning models, DIAL enables multiple tunable units to make independent but collective decisions, reacting to what is happening in the global storage systems in a timely manner and achieving better I/O performance globally for the application.

Abstract: Modern high-performance computing (HPC) applications run on compute resources but share global storage systems. This design can cause problems when applications consume a disproportionate amount of storage bandwidth relative to their allocated compute resources. For example, an application running on a single compute node can issue many small, random writes and consume excessive I/O bandwidth from a storage server. This can hinder larger jobs that write to the same storage server and are allocated many compute nodes, resulting in significant resource waste.
  A straightforward solution is to limit each application's I/O bandwidth on storage servers in proportion to its allocated compute resources. This approach has been implemented in parallel file systems using Token Bucket Filter (TBF). However, strict proportional limits often reduce overall I/O efficiency because HPC applications generate short, bursty I/O. Limiting bandwidth can waste server capacity when applications are idle or prevent applications from temporarily using higher bandwidth during bursty phases.
  We argue that I/O control should maximize per-application performance and overall storage efficiency while ensuring fairness (e.g., preventing small jobs from blocking large-scale ones). We propose AdapTBF, which builds on TBF in modern parallel file systems (e.g., Lustre) and introduces a decentralized bandwidth control approach using adaptive borrowing and lending. We detail the algorithm, implement AdapTBF in Lustre, and evaluate it using synthetic workloads modeled after real-world scenarios. Results show that AdapTBF manages I/O bandwidth effectively while maintaining high storage utilization, even under extreme conditions.

Abstract: Tuning parallel file system in High-Performance Computing (HPC) systems remains challenging due to the complex I/O paths, diverse I/O patterns, and dynamic system conditions. While existing autotuning frameworks have shown promising results in tuning PFS parameters based on applications' I/O patterns, they lack scalability, adaptivity, and the ability to operate online. In this work, focusing on scalable online tuning, we present CARAT, an ML-guided framework to co-tune client-side RPC and caching parameters of PFS, leveraging only locally observable metrics. Unlike global or pattern-dependent approaches, CARAT enables each client to make independent and intelligent tuning decisions online, responding to real-time changes in both application I/O behaviors and system states. We then prototyped CARAT using Lustre and evaluated it extensively across dynamic I/O patterns, real-world HPC workloads, and multi-client deployments. The results demonstrated that CARAT can achieve up to 3x performance improvement over the default or static configurations, validating the effectiveness and generality of our approach. Due to its scalability and lightweight, we believe CARAT has the potential to be widely deployed into existing PFS and benefit various data-intensive applications.

Abstract: Machine learning training pipelines consume data in batches. A single training step may require thousands of samples drawn from shards distributed across a storage cluster. Issuing thousands of individual GET requests incurs per-request overhead that often dominates data transfer time. To solve this problem, we introduce GetBatch - a new object store API that elevates batch retrieval to a first-class storage operation, replacing independent GET operations with a single deterministic, fault-tolerant streaming execution. GetBatch achieves up to 15x throughput improvement for small objects and, in a production training workload, reduces P95 batch retrieval latency by 2x and P99 per-object tail latency by 3.7x compared to individual GET requests.

Abstract: Fully Sharded Data Parallel (FSDP), also known as ZeRO, is widely used for training large-scale models, featuring its flexibility and minimal intrusion on model code. However, current FSDP systems struggle with structure-aware training methods (e.g., block-wise quantized training) and with non-element-wise optimizers (e.g., Shampoo and Muon) used in cutting-edge models (e.g., Gemini, Kimi K2). FSDP's fixed element- or row-wise sharding formats conflict with the block-structured computations. In addition, today's implementations fall short in communication and memory efficiency, limiting scaling to tens of thousands of GPUs. We introduce veScale-FSDP, a redesigned FSDP system that couples a flexible sharding format, RaggedShard, with a structure-aware planning algorithm to deliver both flexibility and performance at scale. veScale-FSDP natively supports efficient data placement required by FSDP, empowering block-wise quantization and non-element-wise optimizers. As a result, veScale-FSDP achieves 5~66% higher throughput and 16~30% lower memory usage than existing FSDP systems, while scaling efficiently to tens of thousands of GPUs.

Abstract: Implementations of Broadcast based on some information dissemination algorithm -- e.g., gossip or tree-based communication -- followed by a correction algorithm has been proposed previously. This work describes an approach to apply a similar idea to Reduce. In it, a correction-like communication phase precedes a tree-based phase. This provides a Reduce algorithm which is tolerant to a number of failed processes. Semantics of the resulting algorithm are provided and proven.
  Based on these results, Broadcast and Reduce are combined to provide Allreduce.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) training or inference across multiple nodes introduces significant pressure on GPU memory and interconnect bandwidth. The Compute Express Link (CXL) shared memory pool offers a scalable solution by enabling memory sharing across nodes, reducing over-provisioning and improving resource utilization. We propose \name, a collective communication library, leveraging the CXL shared memory pool to support cross-node GPU operations without relying on traditional RDMA-based networking. Our design addresses the challenges on synchronization, data interleaving, and communication parallelization faced by using the CXL shared memory pool for collective communications. Evaluating on multiple nodes with a TITAN-II CXL switch and six Micron CZ120 memory cards, we show that \name achieves highly efficient collective operations across hosts, demonstrating CXL's potential for scalable, memory-centric GPU communication. Our evaluation demonstrates that \name achieves average performance improvements of 1.34$\times$ for AllGather, 1.84$\times$ for Broadcast, 1.94$\times$ for Gather, and 1.04$\times$ for Scatter, compared to the original RDMA-based implementation over 200 Gbps InfiniBand. \textcolor{dong}{In addition, the evaluation with a case of LLM training shows 1.11$\times$ speedup compared with the InfiniBand while saving production cost by $2.75\times$ in hardware.}

Abstract: Shuffle exchanges intermediate results between upstream and downstream operators in distributed data processing and is usually the bottleneck due to factors such as small random I/Os and network contention. Several systems have been designed to improve shuffle efficiency, but from our experiences of running ultra-large clusters at Alibaba Cloud MaxCompute platform, we observe that they can not adapt to highly dynamic job characteristics and cluster resource conditions, and their fault tolerance mechanisms are passive and inefficient when failures are inevitable. To tackle their limitations, we design and implement FuxiShuffle as a general data shuffle service for the ultra-large production environment of MaxCompute, featuring good adaptability and efficient failure resilience. Specifically, to achieve good adaptability, FuxiShuffle dynamically selects the shuffle mode based on runtime information, conducts progress-aware scheduling for the downstream workers, and automatically determines the most suitable backup strategy for each shuffle data chunk. To make failure resilience efficient, FuxiShuffle actively ensures data availability with multi-replica failover, prevents memory overflow with careful memory management, and employs an incremental recovery mechanism that does not lose computation progress. Our experiments show that, compared to baseline systems, FuxiShuffle significantly reduces not only end-to-end job completion time but also aggregate resource consumption. Micro experiments suggest that our designs are effective in improving adaptability and failure resilience.

Abstract: Production LLM serving must simultaneously deliver high throughput, low latency, and sufficient context capacity under non-stationary traffic and mixed request requirements. Data parallelism (DP) maximizes throughput by running independent replicas, while tensor parallelism (TP) reduces per-request latency and pools memory for long-context inference. However, existing serving stacks typically commit to a static parallelism configuration at deployment; adapting to bursts, priorities, or long-context requests is often disruptive and slow. We present Flying Serving, a vLLM-based system that enables online DP-TP switching without restarting engine workers. Flying Serving makes reconfiguration practical by virtualizing the state that would otherwise force data movement: (i) a zero-copy Model Weights Manager that exposes TP shard views on demand, (ii) a KV Cache Adaptor that preserves request KV state across DP/TP layouts, (iii) an eagerly initialized Communicator Pool to amortize collective setup, and (iv) a deadlock-free scheduler that coordinates safe transitions under execution skew. Across three popular LLMs and realistic serving scenarios, Flying Serving improves performance by up to $4.79\times$ under high load and $3.47\times$ under low load while supporting latency- and memory-driven requests.

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) requires substantial compute and energy. At the same time, renewable energy sources regularly produce more electricity than the grid can absorb, leading to curtailment, the deliberate reduction of clean generation that would otherwise go to waste. These periods represent an opportunity: if training is aligned with curtailment windows, LLMs can be pretrained using electricity that is both clean and cheap. This technical report presents a system that performs full-parameter LLM training across geo-distributed GPU clusters during regional curtailment windows, elastically switching between local single-site training and federated multi-site synchronization as sites become available or unavailable. Our prototype trains a 561M-parameter transformer model across three clusters using the Flower federated learning framework, with curtailment periods derived from real-world marginal carbon intensity traces. Preliminary results show that curtailment-aware scheduling preserves training quality while reducing operational emissions to 5-12% of single-site baselines.

Abstract: This study targets cloud native environments where microservice invocation relations are complex, load fluctuations are multi-scale and superimposed, and cross-service impacts are significant. We propose a structured temporal joint load prediction framework oriented to microservice topology. The method represents the system as a coupled entity of a time-evolving service invocation graph and multivariate load sequences. It constructs neighborhood-aggregated and global summarized views based on service level observations. This forms layered load representations across instance, service, and cluster levels. A unified sequence encoder models multi-scale historical context. To strengthen the expression of invocation dependencies, the framework introduces a lightweight structural prior into attention computation. This enables more effective capture of load propagation and accumulation along invocation chains, while maintaining consistent modeling of local bursts and overall trends. The training objective adopts a multi-objective regression strategy that jointly optimizes service level and cluster level predictions to improve cross-granularity stability. We further conduct single-factor sensitivity analyses on key structural and training hyperparameters. We systematically examine the effects of time window length, encoding depth, and regularization strength. The results support the necessity of multi-granularity fusion and structural injection and clarify their effective configuration ranges. Overall, the framework provides a reusable modeling paradigm and implementation path for capacity assessment, resource orchestration, and runtime situational understanding in cloud environments.

Abstract: Modern multi-tenant, hardware-heterogeneous computing environments pose significant challenges for effective workload orchestration. Simple heuristics for assessing workload performance, such as CPU utilization or application-level metrics, are often insufficient to capture the complex performance dynamics arising from resource contention and noisy-neighbor effects. In such environments, performance bottlenecks may emerge in any shared system resource, leading to unexpected and difficult-to-diagnose degradation.
  This paper introduces buoyancy, a novel abstraction for characterizing workload performance in multi-tenant systems. Unlike traditional approaches, buoyancy integrates application-level metrics with system-level insights of shared resource contention to provide a holistic view of performance dynamics. By explicitly capturing bottlenecks and headroom across multiple resources, buoyancy facilitates resource-aware and application-aware orchestration in a manner that is intuitive, extensible, and generalizable across heterogeneous platforms. We evaluate buoyancy using representative multi-tenant workloads to illustrate its ability to expose performance-limiting resource interactions. Buoyancy provides a 19.3% better indication of bottlenecks compared to traditional heuristics on average. We additionally show how buoyancy can act as a drop-in replacement for conventional performance metrics, enabling improved observability and more informed scheduling and optimization decisions.

Abstract: A balanced separator of a graph $G$ is a set of vertices whose removal disconnects the graph into connected components that are a constant factor smaller than $G$. Lipton and Tarjan [FOCS'77] famously proved that every planar graph admits a balanced separator of size $O(\sqrt{n})$, as well as a balanced separator of size $O(D)$ that is a simple path (where $D$ is $G$'s diameter). In the centralized setting, both separators can be found in linear time. In the distributed setting, $D$ is a universal lower bound for the round complexity of solving many optimization problems, so, separators of size $O(D)$ are preferable.
  It was not until [DISC'17] that a distributed algorithm was devised by Ghaffari and Parter to compute such an $O(D)$-size separator in $\tilde O(D)$ rounds, by adapting the Lipton-Tarjan algorithm to the distributed model. Since then, this algorithm was used in several distributed algorithms for planar graphs, e.g., [GP, DISC'17], [LP, STOC'19], [AEDPW, PODC'25]. However, the algorithm is randomized, deeming the algorithms that use it to be randomized as well. Obtaining a deterministic algorithm remained an interesting open question until [PODC'25], when a (complex) deterministic separator algorithm was given by Jauregui, Montealegre and Rapaport.
  We present a much simpler deterministic separator algorithm with the same (near-optimal) $\tilde O(D)$-round complexity. While previous works devised either complicated or randomized ways of transferring weights from vertices to faces of $G$, we show that a straightforward way also works: Each vertex simply transfers its weight to one arbitrary face it lies on. That's it!
  We note that a deterministic separator algorithm directly derandomizes the state-of-the-art distributed algorithms for classical problems on planar graphs such as single-source shortest-paths, maximum-flow, directed global min-cut, and reachability.

Modern deployments increasingly integrate diverse accelerators and near-memory processing technologies, introducing significant hardware heterogeneity, while system software increasingly separates computation, memory, and model components across distributed resources to improve scalability and efficiency. As a result, LLM serving performance is no longer determined by hardware or software choices in isolation, but by their runtime interaction through scheduling, data movement, and interconnect behavior. However, understanding these interactions remains challenging, as existing simulators lack the ability to jointly model heterogeneous hardware and disaggregated serving techniques within a unified, runtime-driven framework.
  This paper presents LLMServingSim 2.0, a unified system-level simulator designed to make runtime-driven hardware-software interactions in heterogeneous and disaggregated LLM serving infrastructures explicit and analyzable. LLMServingSim 2.0 embeds serving decisions and hardware behavior into a single runtime loop, enabling interaction-aware modeling of batching, routing, offloading, memory, and power. The simulator supports extensible integration of emerging accelerators and memory systems through profile-based modeling, while capturing dynamic serving behavior and system-level effects. We validate LLMServingSim 2.0 against real deployments, showing that it reproduces key performance, memory, and power metrics with an average error of 0.97%, while maintaining simulation times of around 10 minutes even for complex configurations. These results demonstrate that LLMServingSim 2.0 provides a practical bridge between hardware innovation and serving-system design, enabling systematic exploration and co-design for next-generation LLM serving infrastructures.

Abstract: I/O performance is crucial to efficiency in data-intensive scientific computing; but tuning large-scale storage systems is complex, costly, and notoriously manpower-intensive, making it inaccessible for most domain scientists. To address this problem, we propose STELLAR, an autonomous tuner for high-performance parallel file systems. Our evaluations show that STELLAR almost always selects near-optimal parameter configurations for parallel file systems within the first five attempts, even for previously unseen applications.
  STELLAR differs fundamentally from traditional autotuning methods, which often require hundreds of thousands of iterations to converge. Powered by large language models (LLMs), STELLAR enables autonomous end-to-end agentic tuning by (1) accurately extracting tunable parameters from software manuals, (2) analyzing I/O trace logs generated by applications, (3) selecting initial tuning strategies, (4) rerunning applications on real systems and collecting I/O performance feedback, (5) adjusting tuning strategies and repeating the tuning cycle, and (6) reflecting on and summarizing tuning experiences into reusable knowledge for future optimizations. STELLAR integrates retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), tool execution, LLM-based reasoning, and a multiagent design to stabilize reasoning and combat hallucinations.
  We evaluate the impact of each component on optimization outcomes, providing design insights for similar systems in other optimization domains. STELLAR's architecture and empirical results highlight a promising approach to complex system optimization, especially for problems with large search spaces and high exploration costs, while making I/O tuning more accessible to domain scientists with minimal added resources.

Abstract: Simulation code for conventional supercomputers serves as a reference for neuromorphic computing systems. The present bottleneck of distributed large-scale spiking neuronal network simulations is the communication between compute nodes. Communication speed seems limited by the interconnect between the nodes and the software library orchestrating the data transfer. Profiling reveals, however, that the variability of the time required by the compute nodes between communication calls is large. The bottleneck is in fact the waiting time for the slowest node. A statistical model explains total simulation time on the basis of the distribution of computation times between communication calls. A fundamental cure is to avoid communication calls because this requires fewer synchronizations and reduces the variability of computation times across compute nodes. The organization of the mammalian brain into areas lends itself to such an optimization strategy. Connections between neurons within an area have short delays, but the delays of the long-range connections across areas are an order of magnitude longer. This suggests a structure-aware mapping of areas to compute nodes allowing for a partition into more frequent communication between nodes simulating a particular area and less frequent global communication. We demonstrate a substantial performance gain on a real-world example. This work proposes a local-global hybrid communication architecture for large-scale neuronal network simulations as a first step in mapping the structure of the brain to the structure of a supercomputer. It challenges the long-standing belief that the bottleneck of simulation is synchronization inherent in the collective calls of standard communication libraries. We provide guidelines for the energy efficient simulation of neuronal networks on conventional computing systems and raise the bar for neuromorphic systems.
