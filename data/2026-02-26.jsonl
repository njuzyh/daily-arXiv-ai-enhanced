Yeo"], "title": "The Tragedy of Chain Commons", "comment": null, "summary": "Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus forms the foundation of many modern blockchains striving for both high throughput and low latency. A growing bottleneck is transaction execution and validation on the critical path of consensus, which has led to modular decoupled designs that separate ordering from execution: Consensus orders only metadata, while transactions are executed and validated concurrently. While this approach improves performance, it can leave invalid transactions in the ledger, increasing storage costs and enabling new forms of strategic behavior. We present the first systematic study of this setting, providing a formal framework to reason about the interaction between consensus and execution. Using this framework, we show that the decoupled design enables a previously unidentified attack, which we term gaslighting. We prove a fundamental trade-off between resilience to this attack and resource capacity utilization, where both are impossible to achieve deterministically in the decoupled model. To address this trade-off, we discuss an intermediate model for leader-based protocols that is robust to gaslighting attacks while achieving high throughput and low latency."}

For forty years, the field has treated this as an immovable constraint, designing around it with randomized protocols, failure detectors, and weakened consistency models. This essay argues that FLP is not a law of physics but a theorem about a particular system model -- and that Open Atomic Ethernet (OAE) circumvents it by rejecting the asynchronous model at its foundation. We introduce the term bisynchronous to describe OAE's key property: bounded-time bilateral resolution in which both parties reach common knowledge of outcome at every round boundary -- a strictly stronger guarantee than synchrony alone. By constructing a bisynchronous, swap-based protocol at Layer 2, OAE sidesteps the load-bearing assumptions of FLP's asynchronous model, achieving deterministic atomic coordination without violating any impossibility result."}

However, FL often results in lower accuracy than traditional ML algorithms due to statistical heterogeneity across clients. Prior works attempt to address this by using model updates, such as loss and bias, from client models to select participants that can improve the global model's accuracy. However, these updates neither accurately represent a client's heterogeneity nor are their selection methods deterministic. We mitigate these limitations by introducing Terraform, a novel client selection methodology that uses gradient updates and a deterministic selection algorithm to select heterogeneous clients for retraining. This bi-pronged approach allows Terraform to achieve up to 47 percent higher accuracy over prior works. We further demonstrate its efficiency through comprehensive ablation studies and training time analyses, providing strong justification for the robustness of Terraform."}

As parallelism increases, scheduling overhead may transition from negligible to dominant, leading to rapid drops in performance for some algorithms, while remaining negligible for others. Although such effects are widely observed empirically, there is a general lack of understanding how algorithmic structure impacts whether dynamic scheduling is always beneficial. In this work, we introduce a granularity characterization framework that directly links scheduling overhead growth to task-graph dependency topology. We show that dependency structure, rather than problem size alone, governs how overhead scales with parallelism. Based on this observation, we characterize execution behavior using a simple granularity measure that indicates when scheduling overhead can be amortized by parallel computation and when scheduling overhead dominates performance. Through experimental evaluation on representative parallel workloads with diverse dependency patterns, we demonstrate that the proposed characterization explains both gradual and abrupt strong-scaling breakdowns observed in practice. We further show that overhead models derived from dependency topology accurately predict strong-scaling limits and enable a practical runtime decision rule for selecting dynamic or static execution without requiring exhaustive strong-scaling studies or extensive offline tuning."}

However, existing collaboration paradigms are constrained to message passing, leaving execution environments as isolated silos. This creates a context gap: agents cannot directly manipulate files or invoke tools in a peer's environment, and must instead resort to costly, error-prone environment reconstruction. We introduce the Agent Workspace Collaboration Protocol (AWCP), which bridges this gap through temporary workspace delegation inspired by the Unix philosophy that everything is a file. AWCP decouples a lightweight control plane from pluggable transport mechanisms, allowing a Delegator to project its workspace to a remote Executor, who then operates on the shared files directly with unmodified local toolchains. We provide a fully open-source reference implementation with MCP tool integration and validate the protocol through live demonstrations of asymmetric collaboration, where agents with complementary capabilities cooperate through delegated workspaces. By establishing the missing workspace layer in the agentic protocol stack, AWCP paves the way for a universally interoperable agent ecosystem in which collaboration transcends message boundaries. The protocol and reference implementation are publicly available at https://github.com/SII-Holos/awcp."}

This paper presents a case study on adapting SAM2 for SEM contour extraction in a few-shot setting. We propose SegSEM, a framework built on two principles: a data-efficient fine-tuning strategy that adapts by selectively training only the model's encoders, and a robust hybrid architecture integrating a traditional algorithm as a confidence-aware fallback. Using a small dataset of 60 production images, our experiments demonstrate this methodology's viability. The primary contribution is a methodology for leveraging foundation models in data-constrained industrial applications."}

Firstly, we present an efficient block coordinate descent (BCD) method to solve the problem. We then integrate deep reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques into the BCD method and propose the DRL-based BCD algorithm. This approach combines the data-driven learning capability of machine learning techniques with the navigational and decision-making characteristics of the optimization-theoretic-based BCD method. This combination significantly improves the algorithm's performance by reducing its sensitivity to initial points and mitigating the risk of entrapment in local optima. The primary advantages of the proposed DRL-based BCD algorithm lie in its ability to adhere to the constraints of the WSRM problem and significantly enhance accuracy, potentially achieving the exact optimal solution. Moreover, unlike many pure machine-learning approaches, the DRL-based BCD algorithm capitalizes on the underlying theoretical analysis of the WSRM problem's structure. This enables it to be easily trained and computationally efficient while maintaining a level of interpretability. Through numerical experiments, the DRL-based BCD algorithm demonstrates substantial advantages in effectiveness, efficiency, robustness, and interpretability for maximizing sum rates, which also provides valuable potential for designing resource-constrained AI-native wireless optimization strategies in next-generation wireless networks."}

Sparse attention significantly reduces self-attention computation by limiting each token's interactions to a subset of tokens. The attention sparsity pattern varies across input prompts, and within a prompt, each attention head can follow a distinct pattern. This makes attention sparsity dynamic. The requirement of generating the sparsity pattern, combined with limited data reuse in attention, shifts the prefill compute to being memory-bound. This, in addition to the huge energy requirements for long-context inference on GPU, motivates FPGAs as good candidates for accelerating dynamic long-context inference.\n  To tackle these challenges, we propose FAST-Prefill, the first FPGA accelerator for long-context prefill-stage inference with dynamic sparse attention. To efficiently generate sparse indices, we propose a \\textit{fused pipeline unit with a memory-aware execution order} to reduce large tensors and irregular memory accesses. To reduce off-chip memory traffic for accessing the KV cache, we utilize the memory hierarchy to design a \\textit{liveness-driven, dual-tier cache}. For high-throughput matrix multiplication, we design a \\textit{hybrid Matrix Processing Unit (MPU)} with DSPs and bit-plane decomposition using LUTs. We implement FAST-Prefill on Alveo U280 and evaluate it on the Llama and Qwen models (batch size = 1) for context lengths ranging from 4K to 128K tokens. We demonstrate an average speedup of up to 2.5$\\times$ in TTFT and 4.5$\\times$ improvement in energy efficiency over GPU implementation on Nvidia A5000 GPU."}

Airavat coordinates a set of agents mirroring expert reasoning: three agents handle problem decomposition, solution design, and code implementation, with assistance from a registry of existing tools. Two specialized engines ensure methodological correctness: a Verification Engine evaluates workflows against a knowledge graph encoding five decades of measurement research, while a Validation Engine identifies appropriate validation techniques grounded in established methodologies.

Yet in deployment, their inference performance is often bounded by the memory capacity, bandwidth, and latency limits of a single GPU, making multi-GPU execution increasingly necessary. Although tensor parallelism (TP) is widely used to scale Transformer inference, applying it to selective SSM blocks is non-trivial because the SSM mixer couples large projections with a sequence-wise recurrent state update and local mixing whose efficiency depends on preserving locality and avoiding synchronization in the critical path.\n  This paper presents a communication-efficient TP design for selective SSM inference that addresses three practical engineering challenges: enabling TTFT improvements via an SSM state cache across prefill and decode, partitioning the mixer's packed parameter tensor so that recurrent updates remain local while minimizing communication, and reducing TP aggregation overhead with quantized AllReduce. We evaluate on three representative SSM-based LLMs spanning pure-SSM and hybrid architectures - Mamba, Falcon-Mamba, and Zamba - on NVIDIA A6000 and A100 clusters. Our experiments show substantial throughput gains from tensor-parallel SSM inference, improving batch-request throughput by ~1.6-2.1x on 2 GPUs and ~2.6-4.0x on 4 GPUs for Mamba, with the largest benefits at long context lengths, and achieving a further ~10-18% throughput improvement from quantized all-reduce by lowering synchronization bandwidth overhead."}
