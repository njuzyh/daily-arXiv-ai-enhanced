Abstract: In April 2024, the White House directed NASA to establish Coordinated Lunar Time (LTC) by December 2026. The programme assumes that a unified time standard can be constructed by deploying atomic clocks on the lunar surface, computing relativistic corrections, and distributing synchronized time via LunaNet. This paper argues that the entire enterprise rests on a category mistake in the sense introduced by Ryle and developed by Spekkens in quantum foundations: it treats "synchronized time" as an ontic entity -- something that exists independently and can be transmitted from authoritative sources to dependent receivers -- when it is in fact an epistemic construct: a model-dependent representation of observer-relative clock relationships. We analyze the cislunar time programme through the lens of Forward-In-Time-Only (FITO) assumptions, Spekkens' Leibnizian operationalism, the Wood-Spekkens fine-tuning argument, and the distinction between ontic and epistemic interpretations that has dissolved long-standing puzzles in quantum mechanics. We show that the same conceptual move that dissolves quantum "mysteries" -- recognizing what is epistemic versus what is ontic -- dissolves the apparent coherence of the cislunar time programme and reveals it as an engineering project built on a philosophical confusion. We sketch a transactional alternative grounded in bilateral atomic interactions rather than unidirectional time distribution.

Abstract: The foundational impossibility results of distributed computing -- the Fischer-Lynch-Paterson theorem, the Two Generals Problem, the CAP theorem -- are widely understood as discoveries about the physical limits of coordination. This paper argues that they are nothing of the sort. They are consequences of a category mistake: treating Forward-In-Time-Only (FITO) information flow as a law of nature rather than recognizing it as a design choice inherited from Shannon's channel model and Lamport's happened-before relation. We develop this argument in six steps. First, we introduce the category mistake framework from Ryle through Spekkens' ontic/epistemic distinction in quantum foundations. Second, we identify FITO as the hidden axiom that unifies the classical impossibility results. Third, we apply Spekkens' Leibnizian principle to show that FITO-based models contain surplus ontological structure. Fourth, we develop the counterfactual: what changes when FITO is dropped. Fifth, we demonstrate that the impossibility theorems are theorems about FITO systems, not about physics. Sixth, we sketch the transactional alternative -- bilateral interactions that dissolve the apparent impossibilities by replacing unidirectional message passing with atomic bilateral transactions. The implication is that distributed computing has spent fifty years optimizing within the wrong design space.

Abstract: Prefill/decode disaggregation is increasingly adopted in LLM serving to improve the latency-throughput tradeoff and meet strict TTFT and TPOT SLOs. However, LLM inference remains energy-hungry: autoscaling alone is too coarse-grained to track fast workload fluctuations, and applying fine-grained DVFS under disaggregation is complicated by phase-asymmetric dynamics and coupling between provisioning and frequency control.
  We present BiScale, a two-tier energy optimization framework for disaggregated LLM serving. BiScale jointly optimizes placement and DVFS across prefill and decode using predictive latency and power models. At coarse timescales, BiScale computes phase-aware placement and baseline frequencies that minimize energy while satisfying SLO constraints. At fine timescales, BiScale dynamically adapts GPU frequency per iteration using stage-specific control: model predictive control (MPC) for prefill to account for queue evolution and future TTFT impact, and lightweight slack-aware adaptation for decode to exploit its smoother, memory-bound dynamics. This hierarchical design enables coordinated control across timescales while preserving strict serving SLOs.
  Evaluation on a 16x H100 cluster serving Llama 3.3 70B with production-style traces shows that BiScale meets TTFT/TPOT SLOs while reducing energy by up to 39% in prefill and 48% in decode relative to DistServe.

Abstract: Massive internet of things microservices require integrating renewable energy harvesting into mobile edge computing (MEC) for sustainable eScience infrastructures. Spatiotemporal mismatches between stochastic task arrivals and intermittent green energy along with complex inter-user interference in multi-antenna (MIMO) uplinks complicate real-time resource management. Traditional centralized optimization and off-policy reinforcement learning struggle with scalability and signaling overhead in dense networks. This paper proposes CADDTO-PPO, a carbon-aware decentralized dynamic task offloading framework based on multi-agent proximal policy optimization. The multi-user MIMO-MEC system is modeled as a Decentralized Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (DEC-POMDP) to jointly minimize carbon emissions and buffer latency and energy wastage. A scalable architecture utilizes decentralized execution with parameter sharing (DEPS), which enables autonomous IoT agents to make fine-grained power control and offloading decisions based solely on local observations. Additionally, a carbon-first reward structure adaptively prioritizes green time slots for data transmission to decouple system throughput from grid-dependent carbon footprints. Finally, experimental results demonstrate CADDTO-PPO outperforms deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) and lyapunov-based baselines. The framework achieves the lowest carbon intensity and maintains near-zero packet overflow rates under extreme traffic loads. Architectural profiling validates the framework to demonstrate a constant $O(1)$ inference complexity and theoretical lightweight feasibility for future generation sustainable IoT deployments.

Abstract: Data centers capable of running large language models (LLMs) are spread across the globe. Some have high end GPUs for running the most advanced models (100B+ parameters), and others are only suitable for smaller models (1B parameters). The most capable GPUs are under high demand thanks to the rapidly expanding applications of LLMs. Choosing the right location to run an LLM inference workload can have consequences on the latency of requests due to these high demands. In this work, we explore options to shift some aspects of inference to the under-utilized data centers. We first observe the varying delays affecting inference in AWS services from different regions, demonstrating that load is not spread evenly. We then introduce WANSpec, which offloads part of LLM generation to the under-utilized data centers. In doing so, WANSpec can mitigate capacity issues as well as effectively use on-site compute (ie at universities) to augment cloud providers. This is done with speculative decoding, a widely used technique to speed up auto-regressive decoding, by moving the draft model to the under-utilized compute resources. Our experiments in simulation and cloud deployments show that WANSpec can judiciously employ redundancy to avoid increases in latency while still reducing the forward passes of speculative decoding's draft model in high demand data centers by over 50%.

Abstract: UCX is a communication framework that enables low-latency, high-bandwidth communication in HPC systems. With its unified API, UCX facilitates efficient data transfers across multi-node CPU-GPU clusters. UCX is widely used as the transport layer for MPI, particularly in GPU-aware implementations. However, existing profiling tools lack fine-grained communication traces at the UCX level, do not capture transport-layer behavior, or are limited to specific MPI implementations.
  To address these gaps, we introduce ucTrace, a novel profiler that exposes and visualizes UCX-driven communication in HPC environments. ucTrace provides insights into MPI workflows by profiling message passing at the UCX level, linking operations between hosts and devices (e.g., GPUs and NICs) directly to their originating MPI functions. Through interactive visualizations of process- and device-specific interactions, ucTrace helps system administrators, library and application developers optimize performance and debug communication patterns in large-scale workloads. We demonstrate ucTrace's features through a wide range of experiments including MPI point-to-point behavior under different UCX settings, Allreduce comparisons across MPI libraries, communication analysis of a linear solver, NUMA binding effects, and profiling of GROMACS MD simulations with GPU acceleration at scale. ucTrace is publicly available at https://github.com/ParCoreLab/ucTrace.

Abstract: Today's distributed systems operate in complex environments that inevitably involve faults and even adversarial behaviors. Predicting their performance under such environments directly from formal designs remains a longstanding challenge. We present the first formal framework that systematically enables performance prediction of distributed systems across diverse faulty scenarios. Our framework features a fault injector together with a wide range of faults, reusable as a library, and model compositions that integrate the system and the fault injector into a unified model suitable for statistical analysis of performance properties such as throughput and latency. We formalize the framework in Maude and implement it as an automated tool, PERF. Applied to representative distributed systems, PERF accurately predicts system performance under varying fault settings, with estimations from formal designs consistent with evaluations on real deployments.

Abstract: We introduce the problem of asymptotic subspace consensus, which requires the outputs of processes to converge onto a common subspace while remaining inside the convex hull of initial vectors.This is a relaxation of asymptotic consensus in which outputs have to converge to a single point, i.e., a zero-dimensional affine subspace.
  We give a complete characterization of the solvability of asymptotic subspace consensus in oblivious message adversaries. In particular, we show that a large class of algorithms used for asymptotic consensus gracefully degrades to asymptotic subspace consensus in distributed systems with weaker assumptions on the communication network. We also present bounds on the rate by which a lower-than-initial dimension is reached.

Abstract: Digital collaboration systems support asynchronous work over replicated data, where conflicts arise when concurrent operations cannot be unambiguously integrated into a shared history. While Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) ensure convergence through built-in conflict resolution, this resolution is typically implicit and opaque to users, whereas existing reconciliation techniques often rely on centralized coordination. This paper introduces a conflict model for collaborative data structures that enables explicit, local-first conflict resolution without central coordination. The model identifies conflicts using semantic dependencies between operations and resolves them by rebasing conflicting operations onto a reconciling operation via a three-way merge over a replicated journal. We demonstrate our approach on collaborative registers, including an explicit formulation of the Last-Writer-Wins Register and a multi-register entity supporting semi-automatic reconciliation.

Abstract: The increasing variety of input data and complexity of tasks that are handled by the devices of internet of things (IoT) environments require solutions that consider the limited hardware and computation power of the edge devices. Complex event processing (CEP), can be given as an example, which involves reading and aggregating data from multiple sources to infer triggering of important events. In this study, we balance the execution costs between different paths of the CEP task graph with a constrained programming optimization approach and improve critical path performance. The proposed approach is implemented as a Python library, allowing small-scale IoT devices to adaptively optimize code and I/O assignments and improve overall latency and throughput. The implemented library abstracts away the communication details and allows virtualization of a shared memory between IoT devices. The results show that optimizing critical path performance increases throughput and reduces delay across multiple devices during CEP operations.

Abstract: iCloud Drive presents a filesystem interface but implements cloud synchronization semantics that diverge from POSIX in fundamental ways. This divergence is not an implementation bug; it is a Category Mistake -- the same one that pervades distributed computing wherever Forward-In-Time-Only (FITO) assumptions are embedded into protocol design. Parker et al. showed in 1983 that network partitioning destroys mutual consistency; iCloud adds a user interface that conceals this impossibility behind a facade of seamlessness. This document presents a unified analysis of why iCloud fails when composed with Time Machine, git, automated toolchains, and general-purpose developer workflows, supported by direct evidence including documented corruption events and a case study involving 366 GB of divergent state accumulated through normal use. We show that the failures arise from five interlocking incompatibilities rooted in a single structural error: the projection of a distributed causal graph onto a linear temporal chain. We then show how the same Category Mistake, when it occurs in network fabrics as link flapping, destroys topology knowledge through epistemic collapse. Finally, we argue that Open Atomic Ethernet (OAE) transactional semantics -- bilateral, reversible, and conservation-preserving -- provide the structural foundation for resolving these failures, not by defeating physics, but by aligning protocol behavior with physical reality.

Abstract: Gaussian processes (GPs) are a widely used regression tool, but the cubic complexity of exact solvers limits their scalability. To address this challenge, we extend the GPRat library by incorporating a fully GPU-resident GP prediction pipeline. GPRat is an HPX-based library that combines task-based parallelism with an intuitive Python API.
  We implement tiled algorithms for the GP prediction using optimized CUDA libraries, thereby exploiting massive parallelism for linear algebra operations. We evaluate the optimal number of CUDA streams and compare the performance of our GPU implementation to the existing CPU-based implementation. Our results show the GPU implementation provides speedups for datasets larger than 128 training samples. We observe speedups of up to 4.3 for the Cholesky decomposition itself and 4.6 for the GP prediction. Furthermore, combining HPX with multiple CUDA streams allows GPRat to match, and for large datasets, surpass cuSOLVER's performance by up to 11 percent.

Abstract: Wildfire monitoring demands timely data collection and processing for early detection and rapid response. UAV-assisted edge computing is a promising approach, but jointly minimizing end-to-end service response time while satisfying energy, revisit time, and capacity constraints remains challenging. We propose an integrated framework that co-optimizes UAV route planning, fleet sizing, and edge service provisioning for wildfire monitoring. The framework combines fire-history-weighted clustering to prioritize high-risk areas, Quality of Service (QoS)-aware edge assignment balancing proximity and computational load, 2-opt route optimization with adaptive fleet sizing, and a dynamic emergency rerouting mechanism. The key insight is that these subproblems are interdependent: clustering decisions simultaneously shape patrol efficiency and edge workloads, while capacity constraints feed back into feasible configurations. Experiments show that the proposed framework reduces average response time by 70.6--84.2%, energy consumption by 73.8--88.4%, and fleet size by 26.7--42.1% compared to GA, PSO, and greedy baselines. The emergency mechanism responds within 233 seconds, well under the 300-second deadline, with negligible impact on normal operations.

Abstract: We introduce a diagonalization-based optimization for Linear Echo State Networks (ESNs) that reduces the per-step computational complexity of reservoir state updates from O(N^2) to O(N). By reformulating reservoir dynamics in the eigenbasis of the recurrent matrix, the recurrent update becomes a set of independent element-wise operations, eliminating the matrix multiplication. We further propose three methods to use our optimization depending on the situation: (i) Eigenbasis Weight Transformation (EWT), which preserves the dynamics of standard and trained Linear ESNs, (ii) End-to-End Eigenbasis Training (EET), which directly optimizes readout weights in the transformed space and (iii) Direct Parameter Generation (DPG), that bypasses matrix diagonalization by directly sampling eigenvalues and eigenvectors, achieving comparable performance than standard Linear ESNs. Across all experiments, both our methods preserve predictive accuracy while offering significant computational speedups, making them a replacement of standard Linear ESNs computations and training, and suggesting a shift of paradigm in linear ESN towards the direct selection of eigenvalues.

Abstract: Error-bounded lossy compression has been regarded as a promising way to address the ever-increasing amount of scientific data in today's high-performance computing systems. Pre-quantization, a critical technique to remove sequential dependency and enable high parallelism, is widely used to design and develop high-throughput error-controlled data compressors. Despite the extremely high throughput of pre-quantization based compressors, they generally suffer from low data quality with medium or large user-specified error bounds. In this paper, we investigate the artifacts generated by pre-quantization based compressors and propose a novel algorithm to mitigate them. Our contributions are fourfold: (1) We carefully characterize the artifacts in pre-quantization based compressors to understand the correlation between the quantization index and compression error; (2) We propose a novel quantization-aware interpolation algorithm to improve the decompressed data; (3) We parallelize our algorithm in both shared-memory and distributed-memory environments to obtain high performance; (4) We evaluate our algorithm and validate it with two leading pre-quantization based compressors using five real-world datasets. Experiments demonstrate that our artifact mitigation algorithm can effectively improve the quality of decompressed data produced by pre-quantization based compressors while maintaining their high compression throughput.

Abstract: Task-oriented Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) networks have recently been proposed to scalably support the large-scale deployment of connected vehicles within the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) vision. In task-oriented V2X networks, vehicles select the content of the transmitted messages based on its relevance to the intended receivers. However, relevance estimation can be quite challenging, especially in highly dynamic and complex vehicular scenarios. Relevance estimation errors can cause a vehicle to omit relevant information from its transmitted message, leading to a content-selection error. Content-selection errors reduce the amount of relevant information available at the receivers and can potentially impair their situational awareness. This work analyses the impact of content-selection errors on task-oriented V2X networks. Our analysis reveals that task-oriented V2X networks feature an inherent resilience to content-selection errors that guarantees a consistent delivery of relevant information even under high relevance estimation error conditions. Moreover, we identify the fundamental conditions underpinning such inherent resilience. These conditions can be encountered in other task-oriented networks where multiple transmitters select the content of their messages based on the task-related requirements of a common set of intended receivers.

Abstract: A Digital Twin (DT) may protect information that is considered private to its associated physical system. For a mobile device, this may include its mobility profile, recent location(s), and experienced channel conditions. Online schedulers, however, typically use this type of information to perform tasks such as shared bandwidth and channel time slot assignments. In this paper, we consider three transmission scheduling problems with energy constraints, where such information is needed, and yet must remain private: minimizing total transmission time when (i) fixed-power or (ii) fixed-rate time slotting with power control is used, and (iii) maximizing the amount of data uploaded in a fixed time period. Using a real-time federated optimization framework, we show how the scheduler can iteratively interact only with the DTs to produce global fractional solutions to these problems, without the latter revealing their private information. Then dependent rounding is used to round the fractional solution into a channel transmission schedule for the physical systems. Experiments show consistent makespan reductions with near-zero bandwidth/energy violations and millisecond-order end-to-end runtime for typical edge server hardware. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first framework that enables channel sharing across DTs using operations that do not expose private data.

Abstract: Underwater localization is essential for marine exploration and autonomous underwater operations, yet existing radio frequency and optical approaches are limited by rapid attenuation or limited visibility. Acoustic sensing remains the most practical choice, but conventional acoustic systems typically rely on large arrays or multiple synchronized anchors, resulting in high hardware costs and complex deployment. This paper introduces a novel low-cost passive acoustic metasurface, MetaBlue , explicitly designed for underwater localization, which, when attached to an ordinary ultrasonic transmitter, transforms it into a directional "super-transmitter." The metasurface embeds direction-dependent spectral patterns into the transmitted waveform, enabling accurate angle-of-arrival (AoA) estimation using only a single hydrophone. For ranging, we present a new EM-acoustic mixed time-of-arrival (ToA) method that leverages the acoustic transducer's inherent low-frequency EM leakage as a timing reference, enabling precise ranging without shared clocks. This allows complete 3D localization with a single low-cost anchor. We evaluate the system across diverse real-world underwater settings, including pools, tanks, and outdoor environments. Experiments show that our design achieves an average AoA error of 8.7 degree and 3D localization error of 0.37 m at distances over 10 m. Even with a single anchor, the system maintains 0.73 m precision.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large AI models imposes stringent demands on data volume and computational resources. Federated learning, though designed to exploit distributed data and computational resources, faces data shortage from limited network coverage and computational constraints from edge devices. To address these issues, both the mixture-of-experts (MoE) and satellite-terrestrial network (STN) provide promising solutions, offering lightweight computation overhead and broad coverage, respectively. However, the satellite-ground relative motion results in intermittent connectivity, hindering conventional federated learning that relies on model synchronization across devices. To leverage the coverage of STN while preserving training efficiency, we propose EMS-FL, an expert-driven model splitting and federated learning method. EMS-FL assigns each device cluster only the experts highly correlated to their local data. Through non-overlapping expert assignments, asynchronous local learning is further proposed, where each device cluster trains its assigned experts consecutively and only uploads local parameters to the satellite during connected phases for aggregation and model updates. Consequently, EMS-FL effectively reduces the training overhead and achieves both faster convergence and higher accuracy compared with conventional federated learning. Rigorous convergence analysis is provided to theoretically characterize the learning performance. Furthermore, comprehensive experiments are conducted using public datasets and large models, validating the superiority of EMS-FL.

Abstract: Low-diameter topologies such as Dragonfly and Slim Fly are increasingly adopted in HPC and datacenter networks, yet existing load balancing techniques either rely on proprietary in-network mechanisms or fail to utilize the full path diversity of these topologies. We introduce Spritz, a flexible sender-based load balancing framework that shifts adaptive topology-aware routing to the endpoints using only standard Ethernet features. We propose two algorithms, Spritz-Scout and Spritz-Spray that, respectively, explore and adaptively cache efficient paths using ECN, packet trimming, and timeout feedback. Through simulation on Dragonfly and Slim Fly topologies with over 1000 endpoints, Spritz outperforms ECMP, UGAL-L, and prior sender-based approaches by up to 1.8x in flow completion time under AI training and datacenter workloads, while offering robust failover with performance improvements of up to 25.4x under link failures, all without additional hardware support. Spritz enables datacenter-scale, commodity Ethernet networks to efficiently leverage low-diameter topologies, offering unified routing and load balancing for the Ultra Ethernet era.

Abstract: Interoperability across industrial automation systems is a cornerstone of Industry 4.0. To address this need, the OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA) Publish-Subscribe (PubSub) model offers a promising mechanism for enabling efficient communication among heterogeneous devices. PubSub facilitates resource sharing and communication configuration between devices, but it lacks clear guidelines for mapping diverse industrial traffic types to appropriate PubSub configurations. This gap can lead to misconfigurations that degrade network performance and compromise real-time requirements. This paper proposes a set of guidelines for mapping industrial traffic types, based on their timing and quality-of-service specifications, to OPC UA PubSub configurations. The goal is to ensure predictable communication and support real-time performance in industrial networks. The proposed guidelines are evaluated through an industrial use case that demonstrates the impact of incorrect configuration on latency and throughput. The results underline the importance of traffic-aware PubSub configuration for achieving interoperability in Industry 4.0 systems.

Abstract: For low-altitude economy (LAE), fast and accurate beam prediction between high-mobility unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and ground base stations is of paramount importance, which ensures seamless coverage and reliable communications. However, existing deep learning-based beam prediction methods lack high-level semantic understanding of dynamic environments, resulting in poor generalization. On the other hand, the emerging large language model (LLM) based approaches show promise in enhancing generalization, but they typically lack rich environmental perception, thereby failing to capture fine-grained spatial semantics essential for precise beam alignment. To tackle these limitations, we propose in this correspondence a novel end-to-end generative framework for beam prediction, called BeamVLM, which treats beam prediction as a vision question answering task capitalizing on powerful existing vision-language models (VLMs). By projecting raw visual patches directly into the language domain and judiciously designing an instructional prompt, the proposed BeamVLM enables the VLM to jointly reason over UAV trajectories and environmental context. Last, experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed BeamVLM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in prediction accuracy and also exhibits superior generalization for other scenarios such as vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) beam prediction.

Abstract: Underwater Acoustic (UWA) networks are vital for remote sensing and ocean exploration but face inherent challenges such as limited bandwidth, long propagation delays, and highly dynamic channels. These constraints hinder real-time communication and degrade overall system performance. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a bilevel Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) framework. At the fast inner level, a Contextual Delayed MAB (CD-MAB) jointly optimizes adaptive modulation and transmission power based on both channel state feedback and its Age of Information (AoI), thereby maximizing throughput. At the slower outer level, a Feedback Scheduling MAB dynamically adjusts the channel-state feedback interval according to throughput dynamics: stable throughput allows longer update intervals, while throughput drops trigger more frequent updates. This adaptive mechanism reduces feedback overhead and enhances responsiveness to varying network conditions. The proposed bilevel framework is computationally efficient and well-suited to resource-constrained UWA networks. Simulation results using the DESERT Underwater Network Simulator demonstrate throughput gains of up to 20.61% and energy savings of up to 36.60% compared with Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) baselines reported in the existing literature.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) inference performance is increasingly bottlenecked by the memory wall. While GPUs continue to scale raw compute throughput, they struggle to deliver scalable performance for memory bandwidth bound workloads. This challenge is amplified by emerging reasoning LLM applications, where long output sequences, low arithmetic intensity, and tight latency constraints demand significantly higher memory bandwidth. As a result, system utilization drops and energy per inference rises, highlighting the need for an optimized system architecture for scalable memory bandwidth.
  To address these challenges we present the Reasoning Processing Unit (RPU), a chiplet-based architecture designed to address the challenges of the modern memory wall. RPU introduces: (1) A Capacity-Optimized High-Bandwidth Memory (HBM-CO) that trades capacity for lower energy and cost; (2) a scalable chiplet architecture featuring a bandwidth-first power and area provisioning design; and (3) a decoupled microarchitecture that separates memory, compute, and communication pipelines to sustain high bandwidth utilization. Simulation results show that RPU performs up to 45.3x lower latency and 18.6x higher throughput over an H100 system at ISO-TDP on Llama3-405B.

Abstract: Deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) on edge devices such as PCs enables low-latency inference with strong privacy guarantees, but long-context inference is fundamentally constrained by limited memory and compute resources. Beyond model parameters, the KV cache becomes the dominant bottleneck due to its linear growth with context length. Although prior work exploits contextual sparsity to evict unimportant KV data, these approaches are largely designed for memory-rich platforms and incur prohibitive data transfer overhead when applied to resource-constrained edge devices with external storage. In this paper, we propose HillInfer, an importance-aware long-context LLM inference framework on the edge that leverages SmartSSD-assisted hierarchical KV cache management. HillInfer jointly manages KV cache pools across the CPU and SmartSSD, and performs in-storage importance evaluation to reduce unnecessary data movement. Furthermore, we design an adaptive, prefetch-based pipeline that overlaps computation and KV data transfer across GPU, CPU, and SmartSSD, minimizing end-to-end inference latency without sacrificing accuracy. We implement HillInfer on a PC with a commodity GPU, and experiments across multiple models and benchmarks demonstrate up to 8.56 $\times$ speedup over baselines while preserving model accuracy.

Abstract: Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) has demonstrated impressive accuracy and low latency for high-dimensional nearest neighbor searches. However, its high computational demands and irregular, large-volume data access patterns present significant challenges to search efficiency. To address these challenges, we introduce pHNSW, an algorithm-hardware co-optimized solution that accelerates HNSW through Principal Component Analysis (PCA) filtering. On the algorithm side, we apply PCA filtering to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset, thereby lowering the volume of neighbor access and decreasing the computational load for distance calculations. On the hardware side, we design the pHNSW processor with custom instructions to optimize search throughput and energy efficiency. In the experiments, we synthesized the pHNSW processor RTL design with a 65nm technology node and evaluated it using DDR4 and HBM1.0 DRAM standards. The results show that pHNSW boosts Queries per Second (QPS) by 14.47x-21.37x on a CPU and 5.37x-8.46x on a GPU, while reducing energy consumption by up to 57.4% compared to standard HNSW implementation.

Abstract: This brief presents a runtime-adaptive, performance-enhanced vector engine featuring a low-resource, iterative CORDIC-based MAC unit for edge AI acceleration. The proposed design enables dynamic reconfiguration between approximate and accurate modes, exploiting the latency-accuracy trade-off for a wide range of workloads. Its resource-efficient approach further enables up to 4x throughput improvement within the same hardware resources by leveraging vectorised, time-multiplexed execution and flexible precision scaling. With a time-multiplexed multi-AF block and a lightweight pooling and normalisation unit, the proposed vector engine supports flexible precision (4/8/16-bit) and high MAC density. The ASIC implementation results show that each MAC stage can save up to 33% of time and 21% of power, with a 256-PE configuration that achieves higher compute density (4.83 TOPS/mm2 ) and energy efficiency (11.67 TOPS/W) than previous state-of-the-art work. A detailed hardware-software co-design methodology for object detection and classification tasks on Pynq-Z2 is discussed to assess the proposed architecture, demonstrating a scalable, energy-efficient solution for edge AI applications.

Abstract: Multi-die FPGAs enable device scaling beyond reticle limits but introduce severe interconnect overhead across die boundaries. Inter-die connections, commonly referred to as super-long lines (SLLs), incur high delay and consume scarce interposer interconnect resources, often dominating critical paths and complicating physical design. To address this, this work proposes an interconnect-aware logic resynthesis method that restructures the LUT-level netlist to reduce the number of SLLs. The resynthesis engine uses die partitioning information to apply logic resubstitutions, which simplifies local circuit structures and eliminates SLLs. By reducing the number of SLLs early in the design flow, prior to physical implementation, the proposed method shortens critical paths, alleviates pressure on scarce interposer interconnect resources, and improves overall physical design flexibility. We further build a tool flow for multi-die FPGAs by integrating the proposed resynthesis method with packing and placement. Experimental results on the EPFL benchmarks show that, compared with a state-of-the-art framework, the proposed method reduces the number of SLLs by up to 24.8% for a 2-die FPGA and up to 27.38% for a 3-die FPGA. On MCNC benchmarks, our tool flow achieves an average SLL reduction of 1.65% while preserving placement quality. On Koios benchmarks, where fewer removable SLLs exist, several designs still exhibit considerable inter-die edge reductions. Overall, the results confirm that reducing inter-die connections at the logic level is an effective approach for multi-die FPGAs.

Abstract: Computer architecture is searching for new ways to make use of increasingly available digital logic without the serial bottlenecks of CPU-based design. Recent work has demonstrated a fully CPU-less approach to executing functional programs, by exploiting their inherent parallelisability to compile them directly into parallel digital logic. This work uses lambda-calculus as a hyper simple functional language to prove the concept, but is impractical for real-world programming due to the well-known inefficiencies of pure lambda$-calculus. It is common in language design to extend basic lambda-calculus with additional primitives to short-cut common tasks such as arithmetic and lists. In this work, we build upon our previous research to examine how such extensions may be applied to CPU-less functional execution in digital logic, with the objective of advancing the approach toward practical implementation. We present a set of structures and algorithms for representing new primitives, describe a systematic process for selecting, implementing, and evaluating them, and demonstrate substantial reductions in execution time and node usage. These improvements are implemented in an open-source system, which is shown to correctly evaluate a range of representative lambda expressions.
