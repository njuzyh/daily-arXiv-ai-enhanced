Abstract: The growing disparity between computational power and on-chip communication bandwidth is a critical bottleneck in modern Systems-on-Chip (SoCs), especially for data-parallel workloads like AI. Efficient point-to-multipoint (P2MP) data movement, such as multicast, is essential for high performance. However, native multicast support is lacking in standard interconnect protocols. Existing P2MP solutions, such as multicast-capable Network-on-Chip (NoC), impose additional overhead to the network hardware and require modifications to the interconnect protocol, compromising scalability and compatibility.
  This paper introduces Torrent, a novel distributed DMA architecture that enables efficient P2MP data transfers without modifying NoC hardware and interconnect protocol. Torrent conducts P2MP data transfers by forming logical chains over the NoC, where the data traverses through targeted destinations resembling a linked list. This Chainwrite mechanism preserves the P2P nature of every data transfer while enabling flexible data transfers to an unlimited number of destinations. To optimize the performance and energy consumption of Chainwrite, two scheduling algorithms are developed to determine the optimal chain order based on NoC topology.
  Our RTL and FPGA prototype evaluations using both synthetic and real workloads demonstrate significant advantages in performance, flexibility, and scalability over network-layer multicast. Compared to the unicast baseline, Torrent achieves up to a 7.88x speedup. ASIC synthesis on 16nm technology confirms the architecture's minimal footprint in area (1.2%) and power (2.3%). Thanks to the Chainwrite, Torrent delivers scalable P2MP data transfers with a small cycle overhead of 82CC and area overhead of 207um2 per destination.

Abstract: Ultra-reliable low latency communication (URLLC) is a key part of 5G wireless systems. Achieving low latency necessitates codes with short blocklengths for which polar codes with successive cancellation list (SCL) decoding typically outperform message-passing (MP)-based decoding of low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. However, SCL decoders are known to exhibit high latency and poor area efficiency. In this paper, we propose a new short-blocklength multi-rate binary LDPC code that outperforms the 5G-LDPC code for the same blocklength and is suitable for URLLC applications using fully parallel MP. To demonstrate our code's efficacy, we present a 0.44mm$^2$ GlobalFoundries 22FDX LDPC decoder ASIC which supports three rates and achieves the lowest-in-class decoding latency of 14ns while reaching an information throughput of 9Gb/s at 62pJ/b energy efficiency for a rate-1/2 code with 128-bit blocklength.

Abstract: The Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) technique has gained significant traction for producing diverse content. However, existing AIGC services typically operate within a centralized framework, resulting in high response times. To address this issue, we integrate collaborative Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) technology to reduce processing delays for AIGC services. Current collaborative MEC methods primarily support single-server offloading or facilitate interactions among fixed Edge Servers (ESs), limiting flexibility and resource utilization across all ESs to meet the varying computing and networking requirements of AIGC services. We propose AMCoEdge, an adaptive multi-server collaborative MEC approach to enhancing AIGC service efficiency. The AMCoEdge fully utilizes the computing and networking resources across all ESs through adaptive multi-ES selection and dynamic workload allocation, thereby minimizing the offloading make-span of AIGC services. Our design features an online distributed algorithm based on deep reinforcement learning, accompanied by theoretical analyses that confirm an approximate linear time complexity. Simulation results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving at least an 11.04% reduction in task offloading make-span and a 44.86% decrease in failure rate. Additionally, we develop a distributed prototype system to implement and evaluate our AMCoEdge method for real AIGC service execution, demonstrating service delays that are 9.23% - 31.98% lower than the three representative methods.

Abstract: This paper investigates an information update system in which a mobile device monitors a physical process and sends status updates to an access point (AP). A fundamental trade-off arises between the timeliness of the information maintained at the AP and the update cost incurred at the device. To address this trade-off, we propose an online algorithm that determines when to transmit updates using only available observations. The proposed algorithm asymptotically achieves the optimal competitive ratio against an adversary that can simultaneously manipulate multiple sources of uncertainty, including the operation duration, the information staleness, the update cost, and the availability of update opportunities. Furthermore, by incorporating machine learning (ML) advice of unknown reliability into the design, we develop an ML-augmented algorithm that asymptotically attains the optimal consistency-robustness trade-off, even when the adversary can additionally corrupt the ML advice. The optimal competitive ratio scales linearly with the range of update costs, but is unaffected by other uncertainties. Moreover, an optimal competitive online algorithm exhibits a threshold-like response to the ML advice: it either fully trusts or completely ignores the ML advice, as partially trusting the advice cannot improve the consistency without severely degrading the robustness. Extensive simulations in stochastic settings further validate the theoretical findings in the adversarial environment.

Abstract: Autonomous AI agents lack traceable accountability mechanisms, creating a fundamental dilemma where systems must either operate as ``downgraded tools'' or risk real-world abuse. This vulnerability stems from the limitations of traditional key-based authentication, which guarantees neither the operator's physical identity nor the agent's code integrity. To bridge this gap, we propose BAID (Binding Agent ID), a comprehensive identity infrastructure establishing verifiable user-code binding. BAID integrates three orthogonal mechanisms: local binding via biometric authentication, decentralized on-chain identity management, and a novel zkVM-based Code-Level Authentication protocol. By leveraging recursive proofs to treat the program binary as the identity, this protocol provides cryptographic guarantees for operator identity, agent configuration integrity, and complete execution provenance, thereby effectively preventing unauthorized operation and code substitution. We implement and evaluate a complete prototype system, demonstrating the practical feasibility of blockchain-based identity management and zkVM-based authentication protocol.

Abstract: This paper addresses limitations of current scheduling methods in the Robot Operating System (ROS)2, focusing on scheduling tasks beyond simple chains and analyzing arbitrary Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs). While previous research has focused mostly on chain-based scheduling with ad-hoc response time analyses, we propose a novel approach using the events executor to implement fixed-job-level-priority schedulers for arbitrary ROS2 graphs on uniprocessor systems. We demonstrate that ROS 2 applications can be abstracted as forests of trees, enabling the mapping of ROS 2 applications to traditional real-time DAG task models. Our usage of the events executor requires a special implementation of the events queue and a communication middleware that supports LIFO-ordered message delivery, features not yet standard in ROS2. We show that our implementation generates the same schedules as a conventional fixed-priority DAG task scheduler, in spite of lacking access to the precedence information that usually is required. This further closes the gap between established real-time systems theory and ROS2 scheduling analyses.

Abstract: Parallel programming remains one of the most challenging aspects of High-Performance Computing (HPC), requiring deep knowledge of synchronization, communication, and memory models. While modern C++ standards and frameworks like OpenMP and MPI have simplified parallelism, mastering these paradigms is still complex. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in automating code generation, but their effectiveness in producing correct and efficient HPC code is not well understood. In this work, we systematically evaluate leading LLMs including ChatGPT 4 and 5, Claude, and LLaMA on the task of generating C++ implementations of the Mandelbrot set using shared-memory, directive-based, and distributed-memory paradigms. Each generated program is compiled and executed with GCC 11.5.0 to assess its correctness, robustness, and scalability. Results show that ChatGPT-4 and ChatGPT-5 achieve strong syntactic precision and scalable performance.

Abstract: Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) have emerged as a promising alternative to Autoregressive Models (ARMs), utilizing parallel decoding to overcome sequential bottlenecks. However, existing research focuses primarily on kernel-level optimizations, lacking a holistic serving framework that addresses the unique memory dynamics of diffusion processes in production. We identify a critical "memory footprint crisis" specific to dLLMs, driven by monolithic logit tensors and the severe resource oscillation between compute-bound "Refresh" phases and bandwidth-bound "Reuse" phases. To bridge this gap, we present dLLM-Serve, an efficient dLLM serving system that co-optimizes memory footprint, computational scheduling, and generation quality. dLLM-Serve introduces Logit-Aware Activation Budgeting to decompose transient tensor peaks, a Phase-Multiplexed Scheduler to interleave heterogeneous request phases, and Head-Centric Sparse Attention to decouple logical sparsity from physical storage. We evaluate dLLM-Serve on diverse workloads (LiveBench, Burst, OSC) and GPUs (RTX 4090, L40S). Relative to the state-of-the-art baseline, dLLM-Serve improves throughput by 1.61$\times$-1.81$\times$ on the consumer-grade RTX 4090 and 1.60$\times$-1.74$\times$ on the server-grade NVIDIA L40S, while reducing tail latency by nearly 4$\times$ under heavy contention. dLLM-Serve establishes the first blueprint for scalable dLLM inference, converting theoretical algorithmic sparsity into tangible wall-clock acceleration across heterogeneous hardware.

Abstract: Scaling Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS) to billions of vectors requires distributed indexes that balance accuracy, latency, and throughput. Yet existing index designs struggle with this tradeoff. This paper presents SPIRE, a scalable vector index based on two design decisions. First, it identifies a balanced partition granularity that avoids read-cost explosion. Second, it introduces an accuracy-preserving recursive construction that builds a multi-level index with predictable search cost and stable accuracy. In experiments with up to 8 billion vectors across 46 nodes, SPIRE achieves high scalability and up to 9.64X higher throughput than state-of-the-art systems.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) extend LLMs with visual understanding through a three-stage pipeline: multimodal preprocessing, vision encoding, and LLM inference. While these stages enhance capability, they introduce significant system bottlenecks. First, multimodal preprocessing-especially video decoding-often dominates Time-to-First-Token (TTFT). Most systems rely on CPU-based decoding, which severely limits throughput, while existing GPU-based approaches prioritize throughput-oriented parallelism and fail to meet the latency-sensitive requirements of MLLM inference. Second, the vision encoder is a standalone, compute-intensive stage that produces visual embeddings and cannot be co-batched with LLM prefill or decoding. This heterogeneity forces inter-stage blocking and increases token-generation latency. Even when deployed on separate GPUs, these stages underutilize available compute and memory resources, reducing overall utilization and constraining system throughput.
  To address these challenges, we present FlashCodec and UnifiedServe, two complementary designs that jointly optimize the end-to-end MLLM pipeline. FlashCodec accelerates the multimodal preprocessing stage through collaborative multi-GPU video decoding, reducing decoding latency while preserving high throughput. UnifiedServe optimizes the vision-to-text and inference stages using a logically decoupled their execution to eliminate inter-stage blocking, yet physically sharing GPU resources to maximize GPU system utilization. By carefully orchestrating execution across stages and minimizing interference, UnifiedServe Together, our proposed framework forms an end-to-end optimized stack that can serve up to 3.0$\times$ more requests or enforce 1.5$\times$ tighter SLOs, while achieving up to 4.4$\times$ higher throughput compared to state-of-the-art systems.
