Switches and routers maintain sketches to track statistical characteristics of network traffic. The availability of such data is essential for the network analysis as a whole. Consequently, being able to recover sketches is critical after a switch crash. In this work, we explore how nodes in a network environment can cooperate to recover sketch data whenever any subset of them crashes. In particular, we focus on frequency estimation linear sketches, such as the Count-Min Sketch. We consider various approaches to ensure data reliability and explore the trade-offs between space consumption, runtime overheads, and traffic during recovery, which we point out as design guidelines. Besides different aspects of efficacy, we design a modular system for ease of maintenance and further scaling. A key aspect we examine is how the nodes update each other regarding their sketch content as it evolves over time. In particular, we compare periodic full updates vs incremental updates. We also examine several data structures to economically represent and encode a batch of latest changes. Our framework is generic, and other data structures can be plugged-in via an abstract API as long as they implement the corresponding API methods."}

However, existing designs rely on a global ordering layer to serialize blocks across instances, an intuitive yet costly mechanism that constrains scalability, amplifies failure propagation, and complicates deployment. In this paper, we challenge this conventional wisdom. We present HYDRA, the first Multi-BFT consensus framework that eliminates global ordering altogether. HYDRA introduces an object-centric execution model that partitions transactions by their accessed objects, enabling concurrent yet deterministic execution across instances. To ensure consistency, HYDRA combines lightweight lock-based coordination with a deadlock resolution mechanism, achieving both scalability and correctness. We implement HYDRA and evaluate it on up to 128 replicas in both LAN and WAN environments. Experimental results show HYDRA outperforms several state-of-the-art Multi-BFT protocols in the presence of a straggler. These results demonstrate strong consistency and high performance by removing global ordering, opening a new direction toward scalable Multi-BFT consensus design."}

To improve output quality, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is an efficient technique that seamlessly integrates local data into LLMs. However, existing edge computing paradigms primarily focus on single-node optimization, neglecting opportunities to holistically exploit distributed data and heterogeneous resources through cross-node collaboration. To bridge this gap, we propose CoEdge-RAG, a hierarchical scheduling framework for retrieval-augmented LLMs in collaborative edge computing. In general, privacy constraints preclude accurate a priori acquisition of heterogeneous data distributions across edge nodes, directly impeding RAG performance optimization. Thus, we first design an online query identification mechanism using proximal policy optimization (PPO), which autonomously infers query semantics and establishes cross-domain knowledge associations in an online manner. Second, we devise a dynamic inter-node scheduling strategy that balances workloads across heterogeneous edge nodes by synergizing historical performance analytics with real-time resource thresholds. Third, we develop an intra-node scheduler based on online convex optimization, adaptively allocating query processing ratios and memory resources to optimize the latency-quality trade-off under fluctuating assigned loads. Comprehensive evaluations across diverse QA benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed method significantly boosts the performance of collaborative retrieval-augmented LLMs, achieving performance gains of 4.23\\% to 91.39\\% over baseline methods across all tasks."}

However, IoV networks face persistent challenges, including low spectral efficiency in vehicular communications, difficulty in achieving dynamic and adaptive resource optimization, and the need for long-term stability under highly dynamic environments. In this paper, we study the problem of digital twin (DT)-assisted task offloading and resource allocation in integrated sensing and communication (ISAC)-enabled IoV networks. The objective is to minimize the long-term average system cost, defined as a weighted combination of delay and energy consumption, while ensuring queue stability over time. To address this, we employ an ISAC-enabled design and introduce two transmission modes (i.e., raw data transmission (DataT) and instruction transmission (InstrT)). The InstrT mode enables instruction-level transmission, thereby reducing data volume and improving spectral efficiency. We then employ Lyapunov optimization to decompose the long-term stochastic problem into per-slot deterministic problems, ensuring long-term queue stability. Building upon this, we propose a Lyapunov-driven DT-enhanced multi-agent proximal policy optimization (Ly-DTMPPO) algorithm, which leverages DT for global state awareness and intelligent decision-making within a centralized training and decentralized execution (CTDE) architecture.

Optimizing transmit beamforming and power splitting in such systems faces formidable challenges, e.g., time-varying channels and multi-tier interference, which create a complex decision landscape where conventional model-free multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) suffers from sample inefficiency due to rarely-encountered state transitions and poor coordination as decentralized agents act independently. This paper proposes the Decentralized World Model with Reasoning Offloading (DWM-RO) framework to address these fundamental limitations. Specifically, each agent employs a world model to learn compact predictive representations of environment dynamics, enabling imagination-based policy training that dramatically reduces required environment interactions. An uncertainty-aware offloading gate monitors local interference levels and model reconstruction errors to trigger selective edge coordination. When activated, a lightweight latent decorrelation mechanism at the edge refines agents' strategic representations, guiding them toward orthogonal actions that minimize resource conflicts. Extensive simulations demonstrate that DWM-RO converges 5 times faster than state-of-the-art baselines while achieving 34.7% higher spectral efficiency and reducing constraint violations by 40%. In dense network scenarios with 10 users, DWM-RO maintains violation rates below 20% while baselines exceed 70%, validating superior robustness."}

Dense hyperdimensional computing (HDC) proves to be efficient over neural networks; however, it still consumes considerable switching power for an ultra-low energy application. Sparse HDC, on the other hand, has the potential of further reducing the energy consumption, yet at the expense of having to support more complex operations and introducing an extra hyperparameter, the maximum hypervector density. To improve the energy and area efficiency of the sparse HDC operations, this work introduces the compressed item memory (CompIM) and simplifies the spatial bundling. We also analyze how a proper hyperparameter choice improves the detection delay compared to dense HDC. Ultimately, our optimizations achieve a 1.73x more energy- and 2.20x more area-efficient hardware design than the naive sparse implementation. We are also 7.50x more energy- and 3.24x more area-efficient than the dense HDC implementation.

Messages are distributed among random subsets of nodes, which must implicitly coordinate their transmissions over shared communication opportunities. The objective is to guarantee the delivery of all shared messages, regardless of which nodes transmit them. We first prove the optimality of deterministic strategies, and characterize the success rate degradation of a deterministic strategy under dynamic message-transmission patterns.

However, the FL-enabled IoA system remains vulnerable to model poisoning attacks, and the prevailing distance and similarity-based defenses become fragile at billion-parameter scale and under heterogeneous data distributions.

Grids have managed the resulting surges by scaling generation capacity, incorporating additional resources such as solar and wind, and implementing demand-response mechanisms. Altogether, these policies influence a region's carbon intensity by affecting its energy mix. To mitigate the environmental impacts of consumption, carbon-aware optimizations often rely on long-horizon, high-accuracy forecasts of the grid's carbon intensity that typically use compute intensive models with extensive historical energy mix data. In addition to limiting scalability, accuracy improvements do not necessarily translate into proportional increases in savings. Highlighting the need for more efficient forecasting strategies, we argue that carbon forecasting solutions can achieve the majority of savings without requiring highly precise and complex predictions. Instead, it is the preservation of the ranking of forecasts relative to the ground-truth that drives realized savings. In this paper, we present LiteCast, a lightweight time series forecasting method capable of quickly modeling a region's energy mix to estimate its carbon intensity. LiteCast requires only a few days of historical energy and weather data, delivering fast forecasts that can quickly adapt to sudden changes in the electrical grid.

Since LCS significantly increases retention errors over time, addressing this problem is essential to ensure the lifetime of modern SSDs employing high-capacity 3D flash memory. In this paper, we propose a novel data randomizer, STate-Aware Randomizer (STAR), which proactively eliminates the majority of weak data patterns responsible for retention errors caused by LCS. Unlike existing techniques that target only specific worst-case patterns, STAR effectively removes a broad spectrum of weak patterns, significantly enhancing reliability against LCS. By employing several optimization schemes, STAR can be efficiently integrated into the existing I/O datapath of an SSD controller with negligible timing overhead. To evaluate the proposed STAR scheme, we developed a STAR-aware SSD emulator based on characterization results from 160 real 3D NAND flash chips. Experimental results demonstrate that STAR improves SSD lifetime by up to 2.3x and reduces read latency by an average of 50% on real-world traces compared to conventional SSDs"}

Despite these benefits, challenges such as startup latencies, static configurations, sub-optimal resource allocation and scheduling still exist due to coupled resource offering and workload-agnostic generic scheduling behaviour. These issues often lead to inconsistent function performance and unexpected operational costs for users and service providers. This paper introduces Saarthi, a novel, end-to-end serverless framework that intelligently manages the dynamic resource needs of function workloads, representing a significant step toward self-driving serverless platforms. Unlike platforms that rely on static resource configurations, Saarthi is input-aware, allowing it to intelligently anticipate resource requirements based on the characteristics of an incoming request payload. This input-driven approach reinforces function right-sizing and enables smart request orchestration across available function configurations. Saarthi further integrates a proactive fault-tolerant redundancy mechanism and employs a multi-objective Integer Linear Programming (ILP) model to maintain an optimal function quantity. This optimisation aims to maximise system throughput while simultaneously reducing overall operational costs. We validate the effectiveness of Saarthi by implementing it as a framework atop OpenFaaS. Our results demonstrate Saarthi's ability to achieve up to 1.45x better throughput, 1.84x reduced costs, while maintaining up to 98.3% service level targets with an overhead of up to 0.2 seconds as compared to the baseline OpenFaaS."}

Doing so delivers superior concurrent performance by freeing up all GPU cores for computation and also lowers interference in the memory sub-system (caches). While DMA collectives show strong promise, prior works have only studied them in limited context (bandwidth-bound transfer sizes only, performance-only).\n  To address this, we provide a comprehensive performance, power/energy and synchronization costs analysis of offloading ML communication collectives (all-gather, all-to-all) to DMA engines on state-of-the-art AMD Instinct MI300X GPUs. Our analysis reveals that, compared to the state-of-the-art RCCL communication collectives library, DMA collectives are at-par or better for large sizes (10s of MB to GB) in terms of both performance (16% better) and power (32% better). However, they significantly lag for latency-bound small sizes; 4.5X and 2.5X slower for all-gather and all-to-all, respectively. We provide a detailed latency breakdown of a DMA transfer and identify that DMA command scheduling and synchronization costs can limit DMA collective performance. To tackle this, we harness existing DMA architecture innovations, hitherto untapped, to build optimized DMA collectives and demonstrate their efficacy on real hardware. Our optimized implementations considerably close the performance gap for DMA collectives at smaller sizes (30% slower and 20% faster all-gather and all-to-all, respectively) and further improves performance (by 7%) and power savings at larger sizes (3-10%). Overall, this work represents a significant step toward making DMA collectives suitable for adoption in mainstream collective libraries."}

To accelerate Picard iteration for predicting dynamics of APP, a GPU-boosted high-performance Multi-working condition joint Analysis Framework (GMAF) is designed, which adopts Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient method (PCG) using Approximate Symmetric Successive Over-Relaxation preconditioner (ASSOR). GMAF abundantly utilizes GPU device via elevating computational intensity and expanding scale of massive parallel computation. Therefore, it possesses novel performance in analyzing dynamics of both smooth and textured APPs during multiple periods, as the establishment and solution to joint algebraic system for pressure field are accelerated magnificently, as well as numerical integral for force and moment due to oil flow. Compared with asynchronized convergence strategy pursuing local convergence, synchronized convergence strategy targeting global convergence is adopted in PCG solver for the joint system. Revealed by corresponding results, oil force in axial direction and moment in circumferential directly respond to input pressure, while other components evolve in sinusoidal patterns. Specifically, force and moment due to normal pressure instantly reach their steady state initially, while ones due to viscous shear stress evolve during periods. After simulating dynamics of APP and pressure distribution via GMAF, the promotion of pressure capacity and torsion resistance due to textured surface is revealed numerically, as several 'steps' exist in the pressure field corresponding to textures."}

In this paper, we introduce P3-LLM, a novel NPU-PIM integrated accelerator for LLM inference using hybrid numerical formats. Our approach is threefold: First, we propose a flexible mixed-precision quantization scheme, which leverages hybrid numerical formats to quantize different LLM operands with high compression efficiency and minimal accuracy loss. Second, we architect an efficient PIM accelerator co-design for P3-LLM, featuring lightweight compute units to support our hybrid numerical formats. The enhanced PIM compute units significantly boost the computation throughput under iso-area constraints.

Our evaluation on a diverse set of representative LLMs and tasks demonstrates that P3-LLM achieves state-of-the-art quantization accuracy in terms of both KV-cache-only quantization and weight-activation quantization.

We introduce a custom RISC-V core with four novel ISA extensions (FPGA.VCONV, FPGA.GEMM, FPGA.RELU, FPGA.CUSTOM) and integrated neural network accelerators, implemented and validated on the Xilinx PYNQ-Z2 platform. The complete system achieves 2.14x average latency speedup and 49.1% energy reduction versus an ARM Cortex-A9 software baseline across four benchmark models (MobileNet V2, ResNet-18, EfficientNet Lite, YOLO Tiny). Hardware implementation closes timing with +12.793 ns worst negative slack at 50 MHz while using 0.43% LUTs and 11.4% BRAM for the base core and 38.8% DSPs when accelerators are active. Hardware verification confirms successful FPGA deployment with verified 64 KB BRAM memory interface and AXI interconnect functionality. All performance metrics are obtained from physical hardware measurements. This work establishes a reproducible framework for ISA-guided FPGA acceleration that complements fixed-function ASICs by trading peak performance for programmability."}

Doing so delivers superior concurrent performance by freeing up all GPU cores for computation and also lowers interference in the memory sub-system (caches). While DMA collectives show strong promise, prior works have only studied them in limited context (bandwidth-bound transfer sizes only, performance-only).\n  To address this, we provide a comprehensive performance, power/energy and synchronization costs analysis of offloading ML communication collectives (all-gather, all-to-all) to DMA engines on state-of-the-art AMD Instinct MI300X GPUs. Our analysis reveals that, compared to the state-of-the-art RCCL communication collectives library, DMA collectives are at-par or better for large sizes (10s of MB to GB) in terms of both performance (16% better) and power (32% better). However, they significantly lag for latency-bound small sizes; 4.5X and 2.5X slower for all-gather and all-to-all, respectively. We provide a detailed latency breakdown of a DMA transfer and identify that DMA command scheduling and synchronization costs can limit DMA collective performance. To tackle this, we harness existing DMA architecture innovations, hitherto untapped, to build optimized DMA collectives and demonstrate their efficacy on real hardware. Our optimized implementations considerably close the performance gap for DMA collectives at smaller sizes (30% slower and 20% faster all-gather and all-to-all, respectively) and further improves performance (by 7%) and power savings at larger sizes (3-10%). Overall, this work represents a significant step toward making DMA collectives suitable for adoption in mainstream collective libraries."}
