However, there are some barriers that\nprevent the exploitation of the full potential of this technology. First, the\nmajor cloud providers currently put the onus of implementing the mechanisms\nthat ensure compliance with the desired service levels on cloud consumers.\nHowever, consumers do not have the required expertise. Since each cloud\nprovider exports a different set of low-level metrics, the strategies defined\nto ensure compliance with the established service-level agreement (SLA) are\nbound to a particular cloud provider. This fosters provider lock-in and\nprevents consumers from benefiting from the advantages of multi-cloud\nenvironments. This paper presents a solution to the problem of automatically\ntranslating SLAs into objectives expressed as metrics that can be measured\nacross multiple cloud providers. First, we propose an intelligent\nknowledge-based system capable of automatically translating high-level SLAs\ndefined by cloud consumers into a set of conditions expressed as vendor-neutral\nmetrics, providing feedback to cloud consumers (intelligent tutoring system).\nSecondly, we present the set of vendor-neutral metrics and explain how they can\nbe measured for the different cloud providers.

The most standard variant of the\nproblem asks for a proper vertex coloring of a graph with $\\Delta+1$ colors,\nwhere $\\Delta$ is the maximum degree of the graph. Despite an immense amount of\nwork on distributed coloring problems in the distributed setting, determining\nthe deterministic complexity of $(\\Delta+1)$-coloring in the standard message\npassing model remains one of the most important open questions of the area. In\nthis paper, we aim to improve our understanding of the deterministic complexity\nof $(\\Delta+1)$-coloring as a function of $\\Delta$ in a special family of\ngraphs for which significantly faster algorithms are already known. The\nneighborhood independence $\\theta$ of a graph is the maximum number of pairwise\nnon-adjacent neighbors of some node of the graph. In general, in graphs of\nneighborhood independence $\\theta=O(1)$ (e.g., line graphs), it is known that\n$(\\Delta+1)$-coloring can be solved in $2^{O(\\sqrt{\\log\\Delta})}+O(\\log^* n)$\nrounds. In the present paper, we significantly improve this result, and we show\nthat in graphs of neighborhood independence $\\theta$, a $(\\Delta+1)$-coloring\ncan be computed in $(\\theta\\cdot\\log\\Delta)^{O(\\log\\log\\Delta /\n\\log\\log\\log\\Delta)}+O(\\log^* n)$ rounds and thus in quasipolylogarithmic time\nin $\\Delta$ as long as $\\theta$ is at most polylogarithmic in $\\Delta$. We also\nshow that the known approach that leads to a polylogarithmic in $\\Delta$\nalgorithm for $(2\\Delta-1)$-edge coloring already fails for edge colorings of\nhypergraphs of rank at least $3$."}

However, substantial data demands considerable energy\nduring computation and transmission. Redundant deployment or mobile assistance\nis essential to cover the target area reliably with fault-prone sensors.\nConsequently, the ``butterfly effect\" may appear during the IoT operation,\nsince unreasonable data overlap could result in many duplicate data. To this\nend, we propose Senses, a novel online energy saving solution for edge IoT\nnetworks, with the insight of sensing and storing less at the network edge by\nadopting Muti-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). Senses achieves data\nde-duplication by dynamically adjusting sensor coverage at the sensor level.\nFor exceptional cases where sensor coverage cannot be altered, Senses conducts\ndata partitioning and eliminates redundant data at the controller level.\nFurthermore, at the global level, considering the heterogeneity of IoT devices,\nSenses balances the operational duration among the devices to prolong the\noverall operational duration of edge IoT networks. We evaluate the performance\nof Senses through testbed experiments and simulations. The results show that\nSenses saves 11.37% of energy consumption on control devices and prolongs 20%\noverall operational duration of the IoT device network."}
