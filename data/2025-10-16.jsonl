Dodoor leverages advanced\nresearch on the weighted balls-into-bins model with b-batched setting. Unlike\nother decentralized schedulers that rely on real-time probing of remote\nservers, Dodoor makes scheduling decisions based on cached server information,\nwhich is updated in batches, to reduce communication overheads. To schedule\ntasks with dynamic, multidimensional resource requirements in heterogeneous\ncluster, Dodoor uses a novel load score to measure servers' loads for each\nscheduled task. This score captures the anti-affinity between servers and tasks\nin contrast to the commonly used heuristic of counting pending tasks to balance\nload. On a 101-node heterogeneous cluster, Dodoor is evaluated using two\nworkloads: (i) simulated Azure virtual machines placements and (ii) real\nserverless Python functions executions in Docker. The evaluation shows that\nDodoor reduces scheduling messages by 55--66% on both workloads. Dodoor can\nalso increase throughput by up to 33.2% and 21.5%, reduce mean makespan latency\nby 12.1% and 7.2%, and improve tail latency by 21.9% and 24.6% across the two\nworkloads."}

Infrastructure-sparse regions\nsuffer cascading penalties: remote PoPs force distant resolver selection, which\ntriggers CDN mis-localization, pushing latencies beyond 200 ms.\nDense-infrastructure regions show minimal sensitivity to PoP changes.\nLeveraging Starlink's infrastructure expansion in early 2025 as a natural\nexperiment, we demonstrate that relocating PoPs closer to user location reduces\nmedian page-fetch times by 60%. Our findings reveal that infrastructure\nproximity, not satellite coverage, influences web performance, requiring\nfundamental changes to CDN mapping and DNS resolution for satellite ISPs."}

We propose two dynamic and\nscalable pilot assignment strategies designed for practical deployment in such\nnetworks. First, we present a low complexity centralized algorithm that\nsequentially assigns pilots to user equipments (UEs) to minimize the global\nchannel estimation errors across serving access points (APs). This improves the\nchannel estimation quality and reduces interference among UEs, enhancing the\nspectral efficiency. Second, we develop a fully distributed algorithm that uses\na priority-based pilot selection approach. In this algorithm, each selected AP\nminimizes estimation error using only local information and offers candidate\npilots to the UEs. Every UE then selects a suitable pilot based on AP priority.\nThis approach ensures consistency and minimizes interference while\nsignificantly reducing pilot contamination. The method requires no global\ncoordination, maintains low signaling overhead, and adapts dynamically to the\nUE deployment. Numerical simulations demonstrate the superiority of our\nproposed schemes in terms of network throughput when compared to other\nstate-of-the-art benchmark schemes."}
