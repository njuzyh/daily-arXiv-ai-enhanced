In\nthe decentralized design, a controller fault only impacts its slice of the\nnetwork, limiting the blast radius to a fraction of the network. However, we\nfind that autonomous slice controllers can arrive at divergent traffic\nallocations that overload links by 30% beyond their capacity. We present\nSymphony, a decentralized TE system that addresses the challenge of\ndivergence-induced congestion while preserving the fault-isolation benefits of\ndecentralization. By augmenting TE objectives with quadratic regularization,\nSymphony makes traffic allocations robust to demand perturbations, ensuring TE\ncontrollers naturally converge to compatible allocations without coordination.\nIn parallel, Symphony's randomized slicing algorithm partitions the network to\nminimize blast radius by distributing critical traffic sources across slices,\npreventing any single failure from becoming catastrophic. These innovations\nwork in tandem: regularization ensures algorithmic stability to traffic\nallocations while intelligent slicing provides architectural resilience in the\nnetwork. Through extensive evaluation on cloud provider WANs, we show Symphony\nreduces divergence-induced congestion by 14x and blast radius by 79% compared\nto current practice."}

Descriptor-based\ndirect memory access controllers (DMACs) allow such transfers to be executed by\ndecoupling memory transfers from processing units. Classical descriptor-based\nDMACs are inefficient when handling arbitrary transfers of small unit sizes.\nExcessive descriptor size and the serialized nature of processing descriptors\nemployed by the DMAC lead to large static overheads when setting up transfers.\nTo tackle this inefficiency, we propose a descriptor-based DMAC optimized to\nefficiently handle arbitrary transfers of small unit sizes. We implement a\nlightweight descriptor format in an AXI4-based DMAC. We further increase\nperformance by implementing a low-overhead speculative descriptor prefetching\nscheme without additional latency penalties in the case of a misprediction. Our\nDMAC is integrated into a 64-bit Linux-capable RISC-V SoC and emulated on a\nKintex FPGA to evaluate its performance. Compared to an off-the-shelf\ndescriptor-based DMAC IP, we achieve 1.66x less latency launching transfers,\nincrease bus utilization up to 2.5x in an ideal memory system with\n64-byte-length transfers while requiring 11% fewer lookup tables, 23% fewer\nflip-flops, and no block RAMs. We can extend our lead in bus utilization to\n3.6x with 64-byte-length transfers in deep memory systems.

We propose Metronome, a network-aware and priority-aware\nscheduling mechanism for cloud native networks. This mechanism is designed to\nsupport jobs that exhibit periodic traffic patterns and dynamic bandwidth\ndemands, particularly in the context of distributed training. Specifically,\nMetronome employs a time-division multiplexing approach that leverages job\ntraffic characteristics to construct an elastic network resource allocation\nmodel, enabling efficient bandwidth sharing across multiple jobs. In addition,\nit incorporates a multi-objective optimization strategy, jointly considering\nlatency and job priorities to achieve globally optimal as well as dynamic\nresource allocation. Finally, Metronome adapts to the dynamic environment by\nmonitoring the cluster and performing reconfiguration operations. Extensive\nexperiments with 13 common machine learning models demonstrate that Metronome\ncan enhance cluster resource utilization while guaranteeing service\nperformance. Compared with the existing Kubernetes scheduling mechanisms across\nmultiple scenarios, Metronome reduces job completion time by up to 19.50% while\nimproving average bandwidth utilization by up to 23.20%."}
