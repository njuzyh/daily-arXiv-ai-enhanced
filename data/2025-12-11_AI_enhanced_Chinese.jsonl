This paper addresses a critical challenge of countering intelligent UAV jamming in the context of energy-constrained ambient backscatter communication systems. Traditional anti-jamming techniques often fall short against such dynamic threats or are unsuitable for low-power backscatter devices. Hence, we propose a novel anti-jamming framework based on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) that empowers the transmitter to not only defend against but also strategically exploit the UAV's jamming signals. In particular, our approach allows the transmitter to learn an optimal policy for switching between active transmission, energy harvesting from the jamming signal, and backscattering information using the jammer's own emissions. We then formulate the problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and employ a Deep Q-Network (DQN) to derive the optimal operational strategy.

Recent work enhances HDC accuracy for graph classification via Nystr\u00f6m kernel approximations.

Traditional caching policies, such as Least Recently Used (LRU) and Least Frequently Used (LFU), perform well under specific request patterns. LRU excels in workloads with strong temporal locality, while LFU is effective when content popularity remains static. However, real-world client requests often exhibit correlations due to shared contexts and coordinated activities. This is particularly evident in Virtual Reality (VR) environments, where groups of clients navigate shared virtual spaces, leading to correlated content requests.\n  In this paper, we introduce the \\textit{grouped client request model}, a generalization of the Independent Reference Model that explicitly captures different types of request correlations. Our theoretical analysis of LRU under this model reveals that the optimal causal caching policy depends on cache size: LFU is optimal for small to moderate caches, while LRU outperforms it for larger caches. To address the limitations of existing policies, we propose Least Following and Recently Used (LFRU), a novel online caching policy that dynamically infers and adapts to causal relationships in client requests to optimize evictions. LFRU prioritizes objects likely to be requested based on inferred dependencies, achieving near-optimal performance compared to the offline optimal Belady policy in structured correlation settings.\n  We develop VR based datasets to evaluate caching policies under realistic correlated requests.

A key design principle of NGN is decoupling of service-related functions from the underlying transport stratum, making user services independent of transport technologies. Interestingly, the NGN architecture, as defined in ITU standards, did not follow this design principle for internal network services, e.g., mobility, or authentication though adhering for external user services like IPTV or Multimedia services. These internal services are handled by the NGN transport control plane, making them an intrinsic part of the transport stratum, resulting in a tightly coupled service and transport functionality as opposed to the proclaimed design goal. This design choice may force each transport technology to support internal services individually, e.g., separate authentication service for each transport, leading to duplication. Since the NGN architecture is the base underlying architecture for most packet-based telecommunications network including advanced cellular networks like 4th/5th Generation cellular networks, the limitation persists in these cellular networks as well. To remedy the situation, the decoupling of service and transport can be generalized to include internal services like mobility and authentication also. In this context, the recently published ITU Y.2325 recommendation, defines an evolved NGN architecture, wherein all services, including internal network services, are decoupled from the transport stratum. The proposal results in a more scalable and modular evolved NGN architecture that can be used as a template for all future telecom networks including IMT-2030 (6th generation mobile networks).
