Obtaining the optimal QoS while minimizing resource consumption remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes the streamlined pathway (SP) model, which is a flow scheduling solution that requires minimal statistical knowledge of the DCN data plane. The SP model utilizes the software-defined networks (SDN) paradigm with less information gathered from the DCN data plane, besides the traditional hash-based flow scheduling mechanism, the Equal Cost Multi-Path (ECMP). In SDN, the proposed methodology harnesses a minimal yet powerful set of statistical data extracted from the DCN data plane, including port throughput and elephant flow information on the aggregate switches of the DCN fat-tree topology. Several experiments, in addition to theoretical analysis, have been conducted to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed SP model in terms of QoS enhancement. These results confirm that SP outperforms leading techniques such as Sieve, Hedera, and ECMP, concerning bisection bandwidth, DCN link utilization, packet loss, and packet delivery latency.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "challenges": "Challenges extraction failed", "contributions": "Contributions extraction failed", "results": "Results analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed", "related_work": "Related work extraction failed"}}

In a UAV-CPN, a UAV functions as a dynamic relay, outsourcing computing tasks from the request zone to an expanded service zone with diverse computing nodes, including vehicle onboard units, edge servers, and dedicated powerful nodes. This approach has the potential to alleviate communication bottlenecks and overcome the \"island effect\" observed in multi-access edge computing. A significant challenge is to quantify computing power performance under complex dynamics of communication and computing. To address this challenge, we introduce task completion probability to capture the capability of UAV-CPNs for task computing. We further enhance UAV-CPN performance under a hybrid energy architecture by jointly optimizing UAV altitude and transmit power, where fuel cells and batteries collectively power both UAV propulsion and communication systems. Extensive evaluations show significant performance gains, highlighting the importance of balancing communication and computing capabilities, especially under dual-energy constraints. These findings underscore the potential of UAV-CPNs to significantly boost computing power.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "challenges": "Challenges extraction failed", "contributions": "Contributions extraction failed", "results": "Results analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed", "related_work": "Related work extraction failed"}}

This work investigates whether conventional DSS approaches inadvertently exacerbate the rural digital divide. Through large-scale, 3GPP-compliant non-terrestrial network (NTN) simulations with geographically distributed users, we systematically evaluate standard allocation policies. The results uncover a stark and persistent structural bias: SNR-priority scheduling induces a 1.65x urban-rural access disparity, privileging users with favorable satellite geometry. Counter-intuitively, increasing system bandwidth amplifies rather than alleviates this gap, with disparity rising from 1.0x to 1.65x as resources expand. To remedy this, we propose FairShare, a lightweight, quota-based framework that enforces geographic fairness. FairShare not only reverses the bias, achieving an affirmative disparity ratio of Delta_geo = 0.72x, but also reduces scheduler runtime by 3.3%. This demonstrates that algorithmic fairness can be achieved without trading off efficiency or complexity. Our work provides regulators with both a diagnostic metric for auditing fairness and a practical, enforceable mechanism for equitable spectrum governance in next-generation satellite networks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "challenges": "Challenges extraction failed", "contributions": "Contributions extraction failed", "results": "Results analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed", "related_work": "Related work extraction failed"}}

Test results on two different HPC node architectures, one based on a two-socket Intel Cascade Lake and the other on a two-socket AMD Zen 3, revealed a 25 to 40 per cent speedup compared to traditional GEMM implementations in BLAS when using GEMM of memory usage within 100 MB.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "challenges": "Challenges extraction failed", "contributions": "Contributions extraction failed", "results": "Results analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed", "related_work": "Related work extraction failed"}}

One of the main challenges in parallel BFT is the view change process that happens when the leader node fails, which can lead to performance bottlenecks. Existing parallel BFT protocols typically rely on passive view change mechanisms with blind leader rotation. Such approaches frequently select unavailable or slow nodes as leaders, resulting in degraded performance. To address these challenges, we propose a View Change Optimization (VCO) model based on mixed integer programming that optimizes leader selection and follower reassignment across parallel committees by considering communication delays and failure scenarios. We applied a decomposition method with efficient subproblems and improved benders cuts to solve the VCO model. Leveraging the results of improved decomposition solution method, we propose an efficient iterative backup leader selection algorithm as views proceed. By performing experiments in Microsoft Azure cloud environments, we demonstrate that the VCO-driven parallel BFT outperforms existing configuration methods under both normal operation and faulty condition. The results show that the VCO model is effective as network size increases, making it a suitable solution for high-performance parallel BFT systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "challenges": "Challenges extraction failed", "contributions": "Contributions extraction failed", "results": "Results analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed", "related_work": "Related work extraction failed"}}
