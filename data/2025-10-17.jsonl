By repeatedly opening or keeping a\nDRAM row (aggressor row) open, we show that it is possible to disturb DRAM\ncells through a DRAM column (i.e., bitline) and induce bitflips in DRAM cells\nsharing the same columns as the aggressor row (across multiple DRAM subarrays).\nWith ColumnDisturb, the activation of a single row concurrently disturbs cells\nacross as many as three subarrays (e.g., 3072 rows) as opposed to\nRowHammer/RowPress, which affect only a few neighboring rows of the aggressor\nrow in a single subarray. We rigorously characterize ColumnDisturb and its\ncharacteristics under various operational conditions using 216 DDR4 and 4 HBM2\nchips from three major manufacturers. Among our 27 key experimental\nobservations, we highlight two major results and their implications.\n  First, ColumnDisturb affects chips from all three major manufacturers and\nworsens as DRAM technology scales down to smaller node sizes (e.g., the minimum\ntime to induce the first ColumnDisturb bitflip reduces by up to 5.06x). We\nobserve that, in existing DRAM chips, ColumnDisturb induces bitflips within a\nstandard DDR4 refresh window (e.g., in 63.6 ms) in multiple cells. We predict\nthat, as DRAM technology node size reduces, ColumnDisturb would worsen in\nfuture DRAM chips, likely causing many more bitflips in the standard refresh\nwindow. Second, ColumnDisturb induces bitflips in many (up to 198x) more rows\nthan retention failures. Therefore, ColumnDisturb has strong implications for\nretention-aware refresh mechanisms that leverage the heterogeneity in cell\nretention times: our detailed analyses show that ColumnDisturb greatly reduces\nthe benefits of such mechanisms."}

ScalePool integrates\nAccelerator-Centric Links (XLink) and Compute Express Link (CXL) into a unified\nXLink-CXL hybrid fabric. Specifically, ScalePool employs XLink for\nintra-cluster, low-latency accelerator communication, while using hierarchical\nCXL-based switching fabrics for scalable and coherent inter-cluster memory\nsharing. By abstracting interfaces through CXL, ScalePool structurally resolves\ninteroperability constraints, enabling heterogeneous cluster operation and\ncomposable resource disaggregation. In addition, ScalePool introduces explicit\nmemory tiering: the latency-critical tier-1 combines accelerator-local memory\nwith coherence-centric CXL and XLink, whereas the highcapacity tier-2 employs\ndedicated memory nodes interconnected by a CXL-based fabric, achieving scalable\nand efficient memory pooling. Evaluation results show that ScalePool\naccelerates LLM training by 1.22x on average and up to 1.84x compared to\nconventional RDMA-based environments. Furthermore, the proposed tier-2 memory\ndisaggregation strategy reduces latency by up to 4.5x for memory-intensive\nworkloads."}

Building upon the SJA concept, this paper introduces JASDA-a novel\nparadigm that extends SJA from a largely centralized scheduling model toward a\nfully decentralized negotiation process. In JASDA, jobs actively generate and\nscore feasible subjobs in response to scheduler-announced execution windows,\nwhile the scheduler performs policy-driven clearing that balances utilization,\nfairness, and temporal responsiveness. This bidirectional, iterative\ninteraction embeds feedback, calibration, and probabilistic safety directly\ninto the scheduling loop, enabling adaptive and transparent decision-making. By\ncoupling principles from auction theory and online optimization with the\ntemporal granularity of GPU workloads, JASDA provides a scalable foundation for\nmarket-aware and fairness-driven resource management-bridging theoretical\nscheduling models with practical deployment in modern MIG-enabled environments\nrelevant to Artificial Intelligence and Agriculture 4.0."}

This\noverhead notably impacts HPC workloads involving intensive inter-processor\ncommunication. In response, we introduce MPI-over-CXL, a novel MPI\ncommunication paradigm leveraging CXL, which provides cache-coherent shared\nmemory across multiple hosts. MPI-over-CXL replaces traditional data-copy\nmethods with direct shared memory access, significantly reducing communication\nlatency and memory bandwidth usage. By mapping shared memory regions directly\ninto the virtual address spaces of MPI processes, our design enables efficient\npointer-based communication, eliminating redundant copying operations. To\nvalidate this approach, we implement a comprehensive hardware and software\nenvironment, including a custom CXL 3.2 controller, FPGA-based multi-host\nemulation, and dedicated software stack. Our evaluations using representative\nbenchmarks demonstrate substantial performance improvements over conventional\nMPI systems, underscoring MPI-over-CXL's potential to enhance efficiency and\nscalability in large-scale HPC environments."}

However, VCs introduce significant overhead in the switch in\nterms of area, power, and design complexity, limiting the switch scalability.\nThis paper starts by revisiting VC-less routing through link ordering schemes\nin Full-mesh networks, which offer implementation simplicity but suffer from\nperformance degradation under adversarial traffic. Thus, to overcome these\nchallenges, we propose TERA (Topology-Embedded Routing Algorithm), a novel\nrouting algorithm which employs an embedded physical subnetwork to provide\ndeadlock-free non-minimal paths without using VCs.\n  In a Full-mesh network, TERA outperforms link ordering routing algorithms by\n80% when dealing with adversarial traffic, and up to 100% in application\nkernels. Furthermore, compared to other VC-based approaches, it reduces buffer\nrequirements by 50%, while maintaining comparable latency and throughput.\nLastly, early results from a 2D-HyperX evaluation show that TERA outperforms\nstate-of-the-art algorithms that use the same number of VCs, achieving\nperformance improvements of up to 32%."}

Let $n$ be the number of bins and $m(t)$ the total\nload at time $t$.

For the\ndiscrepancy, we provide a matching lower bound. Furthermore we prove that at an\narbitrarily chosen time $t$ the overload is $\\log\\log(n)+O(1)$. For \"good\"\ninsertion probability sequences (in which the average load of time intervals\nwith polynomial length increases in expectation) we show that even the\ndiscrepancy is bounded by $\\log\\log(n)+O(1)$.\n  One of our main analytical tools is a layered induction, as per [ABKU99].\nSince our model allows for rather more general scenarios than what was\npreviously considered, the formal analysis requires some extra ingredients as\nwell, in particular a detailed potential analysis.
