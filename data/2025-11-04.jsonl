To facilitate rapid prototyping, it offers\na C++ application programming interface and modular configuration options. Our\ndetailed cache model provides accurate insights into performance variations\ncaused by cache configurations, which are not captured by other frameworks.

Our evaluation shows\nthat the prefetcher achieves speedups between 1.08x and 1.88x by reducing\nmemory access latency, while the quicksort accelerator delivers more than 2x\nspeedup with minimal address translation overhead.

Selective postcard schemes\nreduce overhead but miss anomalies that fall below configured thresholds or\noccur during brief intervals. We present Kestrel, a sketch-based telemetry\nsystem for 5G user planes that provides fine-grained visibility into key metric\ndistributions such as latency tails and inter-arrival times at a fraction of\nthe cost of per-packet postcards. Kestrel extends Count-Min Sketch with\nhistogram-augmented buckets and per-queue partitioning, which compress\nper-packet measurements into compact summaries while preserving\nanomaly-relevant signals. We develop formal detectability guarantees that\naccount for sketch collisions, yielding principled sizing rules and binning\nstrategies that maximize anomaly separability. Our evaluations on a 5G testbed\nwith Intel Tofino switches show that Kestrel achieves 10% better detection\naccuracy than existing selective postcard schemes while reducing export\nbandwidth by 10x."}
