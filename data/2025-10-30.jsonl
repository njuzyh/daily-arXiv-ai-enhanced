Detecting\nsuch failures on-chip is challenging, as prior methods from distributed systems\nare unsuitable due to strict memory limits and their inability to track\nfailures across the hardware topology. This paper introduces SlowPoke, a\nlightweight, hardware-aware framework for practical on-chip fail-slow\ndetection. SlowPoke combines compiler-based instrumentation for low-overhead\nmonitoring, on-the-fly trace compression to operate within kilobytes of memory,\nand a novel topology-aware ranking algorithm to pinpoint a failure's root\ncause. We evaluate SlowPoke on a wide range of representative many-core\nworkloads, and the results demonstrate that SlowPoke reduces the storage\noverhead of detection traces by an average of 115.9$\\times$, while achieving an\naverage fail-slow detection accuracy of 86.77% and a false positive rate (FPR)\nof 12.11%. More importantly, SlowPoke scales effectively across different\nmany-core architectures, making it practical for large-scale deployments."}

To this end, we present a high-performance compressible\nreacting flow solver built on the AMReX framework and optimized for multi-GPU\nsettings.

In\nthis paper, we propose a new hybrid precoding approach that combines digital\nand analog precoding to optimize data transmission over multiple antennas. This\napproach steers signals in specific directions, leading to maximizing sum-rate\nand suppressing side-lobe interference. When dealing with complex signals,\nchanges in phase are naturally associated with changes in angle, and these\nvariations are inherently correlated. The correlation between the angle and\nphase is essential for accurately determining the channel characteristics. An\nimportant aspect of this approach is that we model the angle and phase as\ncorrelated variables following a bivariate Gaussian distribution, and for the\nfirst time, we define a joint angle and phase entropy to measure the\nuncertainty of angle and phase variations in wireless channels. This entropy is\ncrucial to adapt the proposed precoding method with variations.

Running many of these applications on IoT devices is challenging due\nto the limited processing resources of these devices and the need for real-time\nresponses. Task offloading can minimize latency by transferring computationally\nintensive tasks from IoT devices to resource-rich edge servers, ensuring delay\nand performance guarantees. In this paper, we develop a task-offloading\napproach for delay-sensitive IoT applications in edge computing environments.\nUnlike existing schemes, we model the task offloading problem as an economic\ndemand and supply model to achieve market balance. The proposed model avoids\nunder- and over-supply, ensuring the computational resources at edge servers\n(supply) are allocated in a manner that best meets the processing and\ncomputational needs of user devices (demand). Given the multi-agent nature of\ntask offloading involving users and service providers with different\npreferences and objectives, we design a game-theoretic framework using a\nVickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) auction. This framework analyzes agent interactions\nand decision-making processes. Additionally, we develop an incentive mechanism\nto encourage both parties to participate in the auction. The mechanism\nmaximizes user task offloading to edge servers and motivates edge servers to\nshare their computational resources, achieving profitability for both IoT users\nand edge servers. Simulations demonstrate our method maximizes social welfare,\nensures truthfulness, maintains market balance, and provides latency guarantees\nfor delay-sensitive IoT applications."}
