We propose a novel geometric framework that models an\nLLM's reasoning as flows -- embedding trajectories evolving where logic goes.\nWe disentangle logical structure from semantics by employing the same natural\ndeduction propositions with varied semantic carriers, allowing us to test\nwhether LLMs internalize logic beyond surface form. This perspective connects\nreasoning with geometric quantities such as position, velocity, and curvature,\nenabling formal analysis in representation and concept spaces. Our theory\nestablishes: (1) LLM reasoning corresponds to smooth flows in representation\nspace, and (2) logical statements act as local controllers of these flows'\nvelocities. Using learned representation proxies, we design controlled\nexperiments to visualize and quantify reasoning flows, providing empirical\nvalidation of our theoretical framework.

While numerous benchmarks measure agent accuracy across domains,\nthey mostly assume full automation, failing to represent the collaborative\nnature of real-world use cases. In this paper, we make two major steps towards\nthe rigorous assessment of human-agent interactions. First, we propose PULSE, a\nframework for more efficient human-centric evaluation of agent designs, which\ncomprises collecting user feedback, training an ML model to predict user\nsatisfaction, and computing results by combining human satisfaction ratings\nwith model-generated pseudo-labels. Second, we deploy the framework on a\nlarge-scale web platform built around the open-source software agent OpenHands,\ncollecting in-the-wild usage data across over 15k users. We conduct case\nstudies around how three agent design decisions -- choice of LLM backbone,\nplanning strategy, and memory mechanisms -- impact developer satisfaction\nrates, yielding practical insights for software agent design. We also show how\nour framework can lead to more robust conclusions about agent design, reducing\nconfidence intervals by 40\\% compared to a standard A/B test. Finally, we find\nsubstantial discrepancies between in-the-wild results and benchmark performance\n(e.g., the anti-correlation between results comparing claude-sonnet-4 and\ngpt-5), underscoring the limitations of benchmark-driven evaluation.

Among them, the AlphaEarth\nFoundation (AE) represents a major step toward a global, unified representation\nof the Earth's surface, learning 10-meter embeddings from multi-source Earth\nObservation (EO) data that capture rich physical and environmental patterns\nacross diverse landscapes. However, such EO-driven representations remain\nlimited in capturing the functional and socioeconomic dimensions of cities, as\nthey primarily encode physical and spectral patterns rather than human\nactivities or spatial functions. We propose AETHER (AlphaEarth-POI Enriched\nRepresentation Learning), a lightweight framework that adapts AlphaEarth to\nhuman-centered urban analysis through multimodal alignment guided by Points of\nInterest (POIs). AETHER aligns AE embeddings with textual representations of\nPOIs, enriching physically grounded EO features with semantic cues about urban\nfunctions and socioeconomic contexts.

They rely heavily on\nmatrix multiplication and require efficient acceleration due to their\nsubstantial memory and computational requirements. Quantization plays a vital\nrole in reducing memory usage, and can be exploited for computations by\ndesigning reconfigurable architectures that enhance matrix multiplication by\ndynamically adjusting the precision. This paper proposes ADiP, a novel\nadaptive-precision systolic array architecture designed for efficient matrix\nmultiplication acceleration.The proposed architecture consists of NxN\nadaptive-precision processing elements (PEs) and shared accumulators. ADiP\nsupports multiple computation modes, including symmetric single-matrix\nmultiplication as well as asymmetric multi-matrix multiplication with a shared\ninput matrix, thereby improving data-reuse and PE utilization. In addition,\nADiP maximizes the computational density by adapting to different precisions,\nsuch as 8bitx8bit, 8bitx4bit, and 8bitx2bit. Analytical models are developed\nfor ADiP architecture, including latency and throughput for versatile\narchitecture configurations. A comprehensive hardware design space exploration\nis demonstrated using 22nm commercial technology, achieving up to a 4x higher\ncomputational throughput. Furthermore, ADiP is evaluated on different\ntransformer workloads from GPT-2 Medium, BERT Large, and BitNet-1.58B models,\ndelivering latency improvement up to 53.6%, and energy improvement up to 24.4%\nfor BitNet-1.58B MHA workloads. At a 64x64 size with 4096 PEs, ADiP achieves a\npeak throughput of 8.192 TOPS, 16.384 TOPS, and 32.768 TOPS for 8bitx8bit,\n8bitx4bit, and 8bitx2bit operations, respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "ADiP\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8109\u52a8\u9635\u5217\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u4e13\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u77e9\u9635\u4e58\u6cd5\u52a0\u901f\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u591a\u79cd\u8ba1\u7b97\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u572822nm\u6280\u672f\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u9ad84\u500d\u8ba1\u7b97\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5728Transformer\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e0a\u5e26\u6765\u663e\u8457\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u80fd\u8017\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "motivation": "Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u77e9\u9635\u4e58\u6cd5\u6709\u5de8\u5927\u9700\u6c42\u4e14\u5185\u5b58\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u8981\u6c42\u9ad8\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u6280\u672f\u53ef\u51cf\u5c11\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u53ef\u91cd\u6784\u67b6\u6784\u6765\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faADiP\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5305\u542bNxN\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5904\u7406\u5355\u5143\u548c\u5171\u4eab\u7d2f\u52a0\u5668\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5bf9\u79f0\u5355\u77e9\u9635\u4e58\u6cd5\u548c\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u591a\u77e9\u9635\u4e58\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff088bitx8bit\u30018bitx4bit\u30018bitx2bit\uff09\u6700\u5927\u5316\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bc6\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u572822nm\u6280\u672f\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u9ad84\u500d\u8ba1\u7b97\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5728GPT-2 Medium\u3001BERT Large\u548cBitNet-1.58B\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6539\u8fdb\u6700\u9ad853.6%\uff0c\u80fd\u8017\u6539\u8fdb\u6700\u9ad824.4%\u300264x64\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0b\u5cf0\u503c\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u5206\u522b\u8fbe\u52308.192 TOPS\u300116.384 TOPS\u548c32.768 TOPS\u3002", "conclusion": "ADiP\u67b6\u6784\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u591a\u79cd\u8ba1\u7b97\u6a21\u5f0f\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u77e9\u9635\u4e58\u6cd5\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e3aTransformer\u7b49AI\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u786c\u4ef6\u52a0\u901f\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

DeCerts allow domain owners\nto specify delegated and non-delegated subdomains, and control the depth of\ndelegation extended by CDNs, which provides flexibility in delegation\nmanagement. But more importantly, DeCerts are built on a new principle which\nprovides full autonomy to domain owners-domain owners can issue DeCerts fully\nindependent of Certificate Authorities (CAs), and thus have greater flexibility\nin policy control, including revocation methods. Such level of flexibility\nwould be hard to match if CAs where to issue such certificates. Revoking a\nDeCert revokes delegation.

Federal organizations have established\nregulatory frameworks to manage shared commercial use alongside\nmission-critical operations, such as military communications. This paper\ninvestigates the potential of machine learning (ML)-based approaches to enhance\nspectrum sharing capabilities within the Citizens Broadband Radio Service\n(CBRS) band, specifically focusing on the coexistence of commercial signals\n(e.g., 5G) and military radar systems. We demonstrate that ML techniques can\npotentially extend the Federal Communications Commission (FCC)-recommended\nsignal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) boundaries by improving radar\ndetection and waveform identification in high-interference environments.\nThrough rigorous evaluation using both synthetic and real-world signals, our\nfindings indicate that proposed ML models, utilizing In-phase/Quadrature (IQ)\ndata and spectrograms, can achieve the FCC-recommended $99\\%$ radar detection\naccuracy even when subjected to high interference from 5G signals upto -5dB\nSINR, exceeding the required limits of $20$ SINR.

Furthermore, we demonstrate that pre-training on the\ngenerated spectrograms significantly improves training efficiency on a\nreal-world radar detection task by enabling $51.5\\%$ faster convergence.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5408\u6210CBRS\u9891\u6bb5\u4e2dLTE\u30015G\u548c\u96f7\u8fbe\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u591a\u6837\u5316\u9891\u8c31\u56fe\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u96f7\u8fbe\u4fe1\u53f7\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u751f\u6210\u6570\u636e\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u96f7\u8fbe\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728CBRS\u7b49\u5171\u4eab\u9891\u6bb5\u4e2d\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7684\u9891\u8c31\u7ba1\u7406\u548c\u5e72\u6270\u6291\u5236\u9700\u8981\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u96f7\u8fbe\u68c0\u6d4b\u7b97\u6cd5\u6765\u4fdd\u62a4\u519b\u4e8b\u4f20\u8f93\u514d\u53d7\u5546\u4e1a\u65e0\u7ebf\u4f20\u8f93\u7684\u5e72\u6270\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u96f7\u8fbe\u4fe1\u53f7\u7f55\u89c1\u4e14\u51fa\u73b0\u9891\u7387\u4f4e\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6536\u96c6\u548c\u6807\u6ce8\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u5c04\u9891\u9891\u8c31\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86AI\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5408\u6210CBRS\u9891\u6bb5\u4e2d\u4e94\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u522b\uff08\u6574\u5408LTE\u30015G\u548c\u96f7\u8fbe\u4fe1\u53f7\uff09\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u4e14\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u9891\u8c31\u56fe\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u6307\u6570\uff08SSIM\uff09\u548c\u5cf0\u503c\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\uff08PSNR\uff09\u7b49\u5e7f\u6cdb\u63a5\u53d7\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u7684\u9891\u8c31\u56fe\u8fdb\u884c\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u7edf\u8ba1\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u751f\u6210\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u901a\u8fc7SSIM\u548cPSNR\u6307\u6807\u8fdb\u884c\u91cf\u5316\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u751f\u6210\u7684\u9891\u8c31\u56fe\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u96f7\u8fbe\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b051.5%\u7684\u66f4\u5feb\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6269\u6563\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u96f7\u8fbe\u4fe1\u53f7\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5408\u6210\u7684\u9891\u8c31\u56fe\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347AI\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u96f7\u8fbe\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

We address this gap using LLM debate to examine deliberative\ndynamics and value alignment in multi-turn settings by prompting subsets of\nthree models (GPT-4.1, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, and Gemini 2.0 Flash) to collectively\nassign blame in 1,000 everyday dilemmas from Reddit's \"Am I the Asshole\"\ncommunity. We use both synchronous (parallel responses) and round-robin\n(sequential responses) formats to test order effects and verdict revision. Our\nfindings show striking behavioral differences. In the synchronous setting, GPT\nshowed strong inertia (0.6-3.1% revision rates) while Claude and Gemini were\nfar more flexible (28-41%). Value patterns also diverged: GPT emphasized\npersonal autonomy and direct communication, while Claude and Gemini prioritized\nempathetic dialogue. Certain values proved especially effective at driving\nverdict changes. We further find that deliberation format had a strong impact\non model behavior: GPT and Gemini stood out as highly conforming relative to\nClaude, with their verdict behavior strongly shaped by order effects.

Approaches like dense-to-sparse fine-tuning are\nparticularly compelling, achieving remarkable structured sparsity by reducing\nthe model size by over 6.7x, while still maintaining acceptable accuracy.\nDespite this reduction, LLM inference, especially the decode stage being\ninherently memory-bound, is extremely expensive on conventional Von-Neumann\narchitectures. Compute-in-memory (CIM) architectures mitigate this by\nperforming computations directly in memory, and when paired with sparse LLMs,\nenable storing and computing the entire model in memory, eliminating the data\nmovement on the off-chip bus and improving efficiency.

This\nparadigm, however, suffers from a critical flaw: information collapse. By\nreducing rich, multi-step execution traces to simple success/failure signals,\nexisting methods are rendered blind to the underlying structure of failures,\nfundamentally preventing them from modeling the workflow's failure\ndistribution. We reconceptualize this challenge as a distributional problem. We\npropose a new paradigm where the optimization goal is not to maximize a scalar\nscore, but to directly minimize a workflow's Expected Failure Mass, i.e., the\nintegral of its failure probability density function defined over a\nhigh-dimensional Failure Signature Space (FSS). This distributional lens allows\nus to move from inefficient, zero-order optimization to a principled,\ngradient-like descent on the failure landscape itself. We introduce CE-Graph, a\nframework that operationalizes this paradigm through a novel, failure-driven\nrefinement process.

On the MLE-Benchmark (2025), Operand\nQuant achieved a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) result, with an overall medal rate\nof 0.3956 +/- 0.0565 across 75 problems -- the highest recorded performance\namong all evaluated systems to date. The architecture demonstrates that a\nlinear, non-blocking agent, operating autonomously within a controlled IDE\nenvironment, can outperform multi-agent and orchestrated systems under\nidentical constraints.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}
