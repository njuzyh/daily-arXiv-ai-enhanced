In wildfire response, such drones play a pivotal role in\nmonitoring fire dynamics, supporting firefighter coordination, and facilitating\nsafe evacuation. In this paper, we introduce AeroResQ, an edge-accelerated UAV\nframework designed for scalable, resilient, and collaborative escape route\nplanning during wildfire scenarios. AeroResQ adopts a multi-layer orchestration\narchitecture comprising service drones (SDs) and coordinator drones (CDs), each\nperforming specialized roles. SDs survey fire-affected areas, detect stranded\nindividuals using onboard edge accelerators running fire detection and human\npose identification DNN models, and issue requests for assistance. CDs,\nequipped with lightweight data stores such as Apache IoTDB, dynamically\ngenerate optimal ground escape routes and monitor firefighter movements along\nthese routes. The framework proposes a collaborative path-planning approach\nbased on a weighted A* search algorithm, where CDs compute context-aware escape\npaths. AeroResQ further incorporates intelligent load-balancing and resilience\nmechanisms: CD failures trigger automated data redistribution across IoTDB\nreplicas, while SD failures initiate geo-fenced re-partitioning and\nreassignment of spatial workloads to operational SDs. We evaluate AeroResQ\nusing realistic wildfire emulated setup modeled on recent Southern California\nwildfires. Experimental results demonstrate that AeroResQ achieves a nominal\nend-to-end latency of <=500ms, much below the 2s request interval, while\nmaintaining over 98% successful task reassignment and completion, underscoring\nits feasibility for real-time, on-field deployment in emergency response and\nfirefighter safety operations."}

We propose EPARA, an\nend-to-end AI parallel inference framework in edge, aimed at enhancing the edge\nAI serving capability. Our key idea is to categorize tasks based on their\nsensitivity to latency/frequency and requirement for GPU resources, thereby\nachieving both request-level and service-level task-resource allocation. EPARA\nconsists of three core components: 1) a task-categorized parallelism allocator\nthat decides the parallel mode of each task, 2) a distributed request handler\nthat performs the calculation for the specific request, and 3) a state-aware\nscheduler that periodically updates service placement in edge clouds. We\nimplement a EPARA prototype and conduct a case study on the EPARA operation for\nLLMs and segmentation tasks. Evaluation through testbed experiments involving\nedge servers, embedded devices, and microcomputers shows that EPARA achieves up\nto 2.1$\\times$ higher goodput in production workloads compared to prior\nframeworks, while adapting to various edge AI inference tasks."}
