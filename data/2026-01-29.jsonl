While central processing units (CPUs) and graphics processing units (GPUs) have traditionally served as the primary inference engines, their general-purpose nature often leads to inefficiencies under strict latency or power budgets. Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) offer a promising alternative by enabling custom-tailored parallelism and hardware-level optimizations. However, mapping AI workloads to FPGAs remains challenging due to the complexity of hardware-software co-design and data orchestration. This paper presents AI FPGA Agent, an agent-driven framework that simplifies the integration and acceleration of deep neural network inference on FPGAs. The proposed system employs a runtime software agent that dynamically partitions AI models, schedules compute-intensive layers for hardware offload, and manages data transfers with minimal developer intervention. The hardware component includes a parameterizable accelerator core optimized for high-throughput inference using quantized arithmetic. Experimental results demonstrate that the AI FPGA Agent achieves over 10x latency reduction compared to CPU baselines and 2-3x higher energy efficiency than GPU implementations, all while preserving classification accuracy within 0.2% of full-precision references. These findings underscore the potential of AI-FPGA co-design for scalable, energy-efficient AI deployment."}

A genome study typically begins with sequencing, which produces millions to billions of short DNA fragments known as reads. Read mapping aligns these reads to a reference genome. Read mapping for short reads comes in two forms: single-end and paired-end, with the latter being more prevalent due to its higher accuracy and support for advanced analysis. Read mapping remains a major performance bottleneck in genome analysis due to expensive dynamic programming. Prior efforts have attempted to mitigate this cost by employing filters to identify and potentially discard computationally expensive matches and leveraging hardware accelerators to speed up the computations. While partially effective, these approaches have limitations. In particular, existing filters are often ineffective for paired-end reads, as they evaluate each read independently and exhibit relatively low filtering ratios. In this work, we propose GenPairX, a hardware-algorithm co-designed accelerator that efficiently minimizes the computational load of paired-end read mapping while enhancing the throughput of memory-intensive operations. GenPairX introduces: (1) a novel filtering algorithm that jointly considers both reads in a pair to improve filtering effectiveness, and a lightweight alignment algorithm to replace most of the computationally expensive dynamic programming operations, and (2) two specialized hardware mechanisms to support the proposed algorithms. Our evaluations show that GenPairX delivers substantial performance improvements over state-of-the-art solutions, achieving 1575x and 1.43x higher throughput per watt compared to leading CPU-based and accelerator-based read mappers, respectively, all without compromising accuracy."}

This paper presents an automated framework that converts high-level traffic shaping intents in natural or declarative language into valid and correct traffic control rules. To the best of our knowledge, we present the first end-to-end pipeline that ties intent translation in a queuing-theoretic semantic model and, with a rule-based critic, yields deployable Linux traffic control configuration sets. The framework has three steps: (1) a queuing simulation with priority scheduling and Active Queue Management (AQM) builds a semantic model; (2) a language model, using this semantic model and a traffic profile, generates sub-intents and configuration rules; and (3) a rule-based critic checks and adjusts the rules for correctness and policy compliance. We evaluate multiple language models by generating traffic control commands from business intents that comply with relevant standards for traffic control protocols. Experimental results on 100 intents show significant gains, with LLaMA3 reaching 0.88 semantic similarity and 0.87 semantic coverage, outperforming other models by over 30\\.

X-Sched addresses this gap by integrating counterfactual explanations with advanced machine learning models, such as Random Forests, to efficiently identify optimal configurations. This approach not only ensures that tasks are executed in line with performance goals but also gives users clear, actionable insights into the rationale behind scheduling decisions.

This paper proposes a resource-centric definition of efficiency, isolating the hardware cost required to maintain a non-blocking throughput constraint. By modeling network cost as a function of the Traffic Multiplier (Hop Count) and Router Complexity (Radix), we demonstrate that the optimal topology is determined by the technological ratio between link interface costs ($α$), crossbar switching costs ($β$), and the network concentration ratio. We conclude that while high-radix direct networks optimize efficiency at small to medium scales, indirect networks (e.g., Fat Trees) are required to cap router complexity at massive scales.

Kubernetes is popular due to its state-centric APIs that decouple the control plane into modular controllers. However, to scale out a burst of FaaS instances, message passing becomes the primary bottleneck as controllers have to exchange extensive state through the API Server. Existing solutions opt for a clean-slate redesign of cluster managers, but at the expense of compatibility with existing ecosystem and substantial engineering effort.\n  We present KUBEDIRECT, a Kubernetes-based cluster manager for FaaS. We find that there exists a common narrow waist across FaaS platform that allows us to achieve both efficiency and external compatibility. Our insight is that the sequential structure of the narrow waist obviates the need for a single source of truth, allowing us to bypass the API Server and perform direct message passing for efficiency. However, our approach introduces a set of ephemeral states across controllers, making it challenging to enforce end-to-end semantics due to the absence of centralized coordination. KUBEDIRECT employs a novel state management scheme that leverages the narrow waist as a hierarchical write-back cache, ensuring consistency and convergence to the desired state. KUBEDIRECT can seamlessly integrate with Kubernetes, adding ~150 LoC per controller. Experiments show that KUBEDIRECT reduces serving latency by 26.7x over Knative, and has similar performance as the state-of-the-art clean-slate platform Dirigent."}

However, the balanced workload assumption no longer holds in large language model (LLM) post-training due to the high variance in sequence lengths. Under imbalanced workloads, collective communication creates synchronization barriers, leading to under-utilization of devices with smaller workloads. This change in training dynamics calls for a revisit of the PS paradigm for its robustness to such imbalance. We propose \\textbf{On-Demand Communication (ODC)}, which adapts PS into Fully Sharded Data Parallel (FSDP) by replacing collective all-gather and reduce-scatter with direct point-to-point communication. Compared to FSDP, ODC reduces the synchronization barrier from once per layer to once per minibatch and decouples the workload on each device so that faster workers are not stalled. It also enables simpler and more effective load balancing at the minibatch level. Across diverse LLM post-training tasks, ODC consistently improves device utilization and training throughput, achieving up to a 36\\% speedup over standard FSDP. These results demonstrate that ODC is a superior fit for the prevalent imbalanced workloads in LLM post-training.
