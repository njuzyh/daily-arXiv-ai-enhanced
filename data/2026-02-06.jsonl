Motivated by the observation that commuting operations can be executed in parallel, we introduce conflict-obstruction-freedom: a process is guaranteed to complete its operation if it runs for long enough without encountering step contention with conflicting (non-commuting) operations. This condition generalizes obstruction-freedom and wait-freedom by allowing progress as long as step contention is only induced by commuting operations. We prove that conflict-obstruction-free universal constructions are impossible to implement in the asynchronous read-write shared memory model. This result exposes a fundamental limitation of conflict-aware universal constructions: the mere invocation of conflicting operations imposes a synchronization cost. Progress requires eventual resolution of pending conflicts."}

Many open and proprietary stacks still execute LDPC on general-purpose CPUs, raising concerns about missed-slot events and limited scalability as bandwidths, modulation orders, and user multiplexing increase. This paper empirically quantifies the benefit of offloading 5G-style LDPC5G decoding from a Grace CPU to the integrated Blackwell GB10 GPU on an NVIDIA DGX~Spark platform. Using NVIDIA Sionna PHY/SYS on TensorFlow, we construct an NR-like link-level chain with an LDPC5G encoder/decoder, 16-QAM modulation, and AWGN, and sweep both the number of codewords decoded in parallel and the number of belief-propagation iterations, timing only the decoding phase while logging CPU and GPU utilization and power. Across the sweep we observe an average GPU/CPU throughput speedup of approximately $6\\times$, with per-codeword CPU latency reaching $\\approx 0.71$\\,ms at 20 iterations (exceeding the 0.5\\,ms slot), while the GB10 GPU remains within 6--24\\% of the slot for the same workloads. Resource-usage measurements show that CPU-based LDPC decoding often consumes around ten Grace cores, whereas GPU-based decoding adds only $\\approx10-15$\\,W over GPU idle while leaving most CPU capacity available for higher-layer tasks. Because our implementation relies on high-level Sionna layers rather than hand-tuned CUDA, these results represent conservative lower bounds on achievable accelerator performance and provide a reusable, scriptable methodology for evaluating LDPC and other physical-layer kernels on future Grace/Blackwell and Aerial/ACAR/AODT platforms."}

While most process mining efforts focus on intra-organizational scenarios, many real-world business processes span multiple independent organizations. Inter-organizational process mining, though, faces significant challenges, particularly regarding confidentiality guarantees: The analysis of data can reveal information that the participating organizations may not consent to disclose to one another, or to a third party hosting process mining services. To overcome this issue, this paper presents CONFINE, an approach for secrecy-preserving inter-organizational process mining. CONFINE leverages Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) to deploy trusted applications that are capable of securely mining multi-party event logs while preserving data secrecy. We propose an architecture supporting a four-stage protocol to secure data exchange and processing, allowing for protected transfer and aggregation of unaltered process data across organizational boundaries. To avoid out-of-memory errors due to the limited capacity of TEEs, our protocol employs a segmentation-based strategy, whereby event logs are transmitted to TEEs in smaller batches. We conduct a formal verification of correctness and a security analysis of the guarantees provided by the TEE core. We evaluate our implementation on real-world and synthetic data, showing that the proposed approach can handle realistic workloads. The results indicate logarithmic memory growth with respect to the event log size and linear growth with the number of provisioning organizations, highlighting scalability properties and opportunities for further optimization."}

When multiple users observe anomalies to the same destination, this may reflect shared infrastructure, routing behavior, or congestion. Inferring such shared behavior is challenging because anomaly magnitudes vary widely across devices, even within the same ISP and geographic area, and detailed network topology information is often unavailable.\n  We study whether devices experiencing a shared latency anomaly observe similar changes in RTT magnitude using a topology-agnostic approach. Using four months of high-frequency RTT measurements from 99 residential probes in Chicago, we detect shared anomalies and analyze their consistency in amplitude and duration without relying on traceroutes or explicit path information. Building on prior change-point detection techniques, we find that many shared anomalies exhibit similar amplitude across users, particularly within the same ISP.\n  Motivated by this observation, we design a sampling algorithm that reduces redundancy by selecting representative devices under user-defined constraints. Our approach captures 95 percent of aggregate anomaly impact using fewer than half of the deployed probes. Compared to two baselines, it identifies significantly more unique anomalies at comparable coverage levels. We further show that geographic diversity remains important when selecting probes within a single ISP, even at city scale. Overall, our results demonstrate that anomaly amplitude and duration provide effective topology-independent signals for scalable monitoring, troubleshooting, and cost-efficient sampling in residential Internet measurement."}

To address the issue, one effective and well studied technique is cache prefetching. Many prefetching designs have been proposed, with varying approaches and effectiveness. For example, SPP is a popular prefetcher that leverages confidence throttled recursion to speculate on the future path of program's references, however it is very susceptible to the reference reordering of higher-level caches and the OoO core. Orthogonally, AMPM is another popular approach to prefetching which uses reordering-resistant access maps to identify patterns within a region, but is unable to speculate beyond that region. In this paper, we propose SPPAM, a new approach to prefetching, inspired by prior works such as SPP and AMPM, while addressing their limitations. SPPAM utilizes online-learning to build a set of access-map patterns. These patterns are used in a speculative lookahead which is throttled by a confidence metric. Targeting the second-level cache, SPPAM alongside state-of-the-art prefetchers Berti and Bingo improve system performance by 31.4% over no prefetching and 6.2% over the baseline of Berti and Pythia."}

This paper proposes a novel multi-tier UAV edge computing system where lightweight Low-Tier UAVs (L-UAVs) function as edge servers for vehicle users, supported by a powerful High-Tier UAV (H-UAV) acting as a backup server. The objective is to minimize task execution delays while ensuring the long-term energy stability of the L-UAVs, despite unknown future system states. To this end, the problem is decoupled using Lyapunov optimization, which adaptively balances the priorities of task delays and L-UAV energy cost based on their real-time energy states. An efficient vehicle to L-UAV matching scheme is designed, and the joint optimization problem for task assignment, computing resource allocation, and trajectory control of L-UAVs and H-UAV is then solved via a Block Coordinate Descent (BCD) algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate a reduction in L-UAV transmission energy of over 26% and superior L-UAV energy stability compared to existing benchmarks."}

The system strategically coordinates storage across local platoon vehicles, dynamic VFC clusters, and cloud server (CS) to minimize content retrieval latency. To efficiently manage distributed storage, we integrate large language models (LLMs) for real-time and intelligent caching decisions. The proposed approach leverages LLMs' ability to process heterogeneous information, including user profiles, historical data, content characteristics, and dynamic system states. Through a designed prompting framework encoding task objectives and caching constraints, the LLMs formulate caching as a decision-making task, and our hierarchical deterministic caching mapping strategy enables adaptive requests prediction and precise content placement across three tiers without frequent retraining. Simulation results demonstrate the advantages of our proposed caching scheme."}

Quantization is an effective solution, with INT weights and FP activations being widely adopted to preserve accuracy. Prior works further reduce FP overhead by using block floating point (BFP) activations in linear layers, but fail to extend BFP to attention layers due to severe accuracy degradation, limiting overall efficiency. To address this challenge, we propose Harmonia, an algorithm-hardware co-design framework that enables all-layer BFP activations with a configurable hardware architecture. First, we systematically explore BFP configurations to achieve a better trade-off between accuracy and activation compression across all layers. Second, to reduce KV-cache storage and computation in attention layers, we introduce an asymmetric bit-allocation strategy and computations in attention layers,we introduce an asymmetric bit-allocation strategy combined with a hybrid offline-online outlier smoothing technique. This allow aggressive KV-cache compression from FP16 to 4-bit-mantissa BFP with only 0.3% average accuracy loss. Third, to fully exploit all-layer BFP activations, we design dedicated hardware components, including a reconfigurable PE supporting mixed data formats (BFP-INT and BPF-BFP), a real-time FP16-to-BFP converter, and a tiling-aware dataflow to reduce memory traffic. We evaluate Harmonia on GEMM operations in both linear and attention layers across eight widely used LLMs. Compared with prior works, Harmonia achieves 3.84x (up to 5.05x) higher area efficiency, 2.03x (up to 3.90x) better energy efficiency, and 3.08x (up to 4.62x) speedup on average."}

We implement the framework in a configurable simulation testbed and benchmark its performance against traditional heuristics and reinforcement learning baselines under varied traffic conditions. Our results show that DMWM achieves superior performance in bursty, interference-limited, and deadline-sensitive environments, while maintaining interpretability and sample efficiency.

However, when the paths exhibit different delays, such as in terrestrial and non-terrestrial integrated networks with multi-orbit topologies or in networks characterized by frequent topology changes, like Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite constellations with different elevation angles, traffic delivery may experience packet reordering or triggering congestion control mechanisms. Additionally, real-time traffic may experience packet drops if their arrival exceeds a play-out threshold. Different techniques have been proposed to address these issues, such as packet duplication, packet switching, and network coding for traffic scheduling in DC. However, if not accurately designed, these techniques can lead to resource waste, encoding/decoding delays, and computational overhead, undermining DC's intended benefits. This paper provides a mathematical framework for calculating the average end-to-end packet loss in case of a loss process modeled with a Discrete Markov Chain - typical of a wireless channel - when combining packet duplication and packet switching or when network coding is employed in DC. Such metrics help derive optimal policies with full knowledge of the underlying loss process to be compared to empirical models learned through Machine Learning algorithms."}
