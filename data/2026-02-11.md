Abstract: The burgeoning and ubiquitous deployment of the Internet of Things (IoT) landscape struggles with ultra-low latency demands for computation-intensive tasks in massive connectivity scenarios. In this paper, we propose an innovative uplink non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)-assisted multi-base station (BS) mobile edge computing (BS-MEC) network tailored for massive IoT connectivity. To fulfill the quality-of-service (QoS) requirements of delay-sensitive and computation-intensive IoT applications, we formulate a joint task offloading, user grouping, and power allocation optimization problem with the overarching objective of minimizing the system's total delay, aiming to address issues of unbalanced subchannel access, inter-group interference, computational load disparities, and device heterogeneity. To effectively tackle this problem, we first reformulate task offloading and user grouping into a non-cooperative game model and propose an exact potential game-based joint decision-making (EPG-JDM) algorithm, which dynamically selects optimal task offloading and subchannel access decisions for each IoT device based on its channel conditions, thereby achieving the Nash Equilibrium. Then, we propose a majorization-minimization (MM)-based power allocation algorithm, which transforms the original subproblem into a tractable convex optimization paradigm. Extensive simulation experiments demonstrate that our proposed EPG-JDM algorithm significantly outperforms state-of-the-art decision-making algorithms and classic heuristic algorithms, yielding performance improvements of up to 19.3% and 14.7% in terms of total delay and power consumption, respectively.

Abstract: The performance of large-scale Low-Earth-Orbit (LEO) networks, which consist of thousands of satellites interconnected by optical links, is dependent on its network topology. Existing topology designs often assume idealized conditions and do not account for real-world deployment dynamics, such as partial constellation deployment, daily node turnovers, and varying link availability, making them inapplicable to real LEO networks. In this paper, we develop two topology design methods that explicitly operate under real-world deployment constraints: the Long--Short Links (LSL) method, which systematically combines long-distance shortcut links with short-distance local links, and the Simulated Annealing (SA) method, which constructs topologies via stochastic optimization. Evaluated under both full deployment and partial deployment scenarios using 3-months of Starlink data, our methods achieve up to 45% lower average end-to-end delay, 65% fewer hops, and up to $2.3\times$ higher network capacity compared to +Grid. Both methods are designed to handle daily node turnovers by incrementally updating the topology, maintaining good network performance while avoiding costly full reconstruction of the topology.

Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have gained significant attention in recent years due to their ability to control the reflection of radio-frequency signals and reshape the wireless propagation environment. Unlike traditional studies that primarily focus on the advantages of RISs, this paper examines the negative impacts of RISs by investigating interference propagation caused by user mobility in downlink wireless systems. We employ a stochastic geometric model to simulate the locations of base stations and RISs using the Matérn hard core point process, while user locations are modeled with the homogeneous Poisson point process. We derive novel closed-form expressions for the power distributions of the received signal at the users and the interfering signal. Additionally, we present a novel expression for coverage probability and introduce the concept of interference propagation intensity. To characterize the dynamics of interference caused by user mobility, we adopt an epidemiological approach using the susceptible-infected-susceptible model. Finally, crucial factors influencing the propagation of interference are analyzed. Numerical results validate our theoretical analysis and provide suggestions for managing interference propagation in large-scale multi-RIS wireless communication networks.

Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) offer a low-cost, energy-efficient means for enhancing wireless coverage. Yet, their inherently programmable reflections may unintentionally amplify interference, particularly in large-scale, multi-RIS-enabled mobile communication scenarios where dense user mobility and frequent line-of-sight overlaps can severely degrade the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). To address this challenge, this paper presents a novel generative multi-RIS control framework that jointly optimizes the ON/OFF activation patterns of multiple RISs in the smart wireless environment and the phase configurations of the activated RISs based on predictions of multi-user trajectories and interference patterns. We specially design a long short-term memory (LSTM) artificial neural network, enriched with speed and heading features, to forecast multi-user trajectories, thereby enabling reconstruction of future channel state information. To overcome the highly nonconvex nature of the multi-RIS control problem, we develop a Riemannian diffusion model on the torus to generate geometry-consistent phase-configuration, where the reverse diffusion process is dynamically guided by reinforcement learning. We then rigorously derive the optimal ON/OFF states of the metasurfaces by comparing predicted achievable rates under RIS activation and deactivation conditions. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves up to 30\% SINR improvement over learning-based control and up to 44\% gain compared with the RIS always-on scheme, while consistently outperforming state-of-the-art baselines across different transmit powers, RIS configurations, and interference densities.

Abstract: In recent years, autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) systems have demonstrated significant potential in complex marine exploration. However, effective AUV-based tracking remains challenging in realistic underwater environments characterized by high-dimensional features, including coupled kinematic states, spatial constraints, time-varying environmental disturbances, etc. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a hierarchical embodied-intelligence (EI) architecture for underwater multi-target tracking with AUVs in complex underwater environments. Built upon this architecture, we introduce the Double-Head Encoder-Attention-based Multi-Expert Collaborative Decision (DHEA-MECD), a novel Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithm designed to support efficient and robust multi-target tracking. Specifically, in DHEA-MECD, a Double-Head Encoder-Attention-based information extraction framework is designed to semantically decompose raw sensory observations and explicitly model complex dependencies among heterogeneous features, including spatial configurations, kinematic states, structural constraints, and stochastic perturbations. On this basis, a motion-stage-aware multi-expert collaborative decision mechanism with Top-k expert selection strategy is introduced to support stage-adaptive decision-making. Furthermore, we propose the DHEA-MECD-based underwater multitarget tracking algorithm to enable AUV smart, stable, and anti-interference multi-target tracking. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves superior tracking success rates, faster convergence, and improved motion optimality compared with mainstream DRL-based methods, particularly in complex and disturbance-rich marine environments.

Abstract: Future networks must meet stringent requirements while operating within tight energy and carbon constraints. Current autoscaling mechanisms remain workload-centric and infrastructure-siloed, and are largely unaware of their environmental impact. We present NeuroScaler, an AI-native, energy-efficient, and carbon-aware orchestrator for green cloud and edge networks. NeuroScaler aggregates multi-tier telemetry, from Power Distribution Units (PDUs) through bare-metal servers to virtualized infrastructure with containers managed by Kubernetes, using distinct energy and computing metrics at each tier. It supports several machine learning pipelines that link load, performance, and power. Within this unified observability layer, a model-predictive control policy optimizes energy use while meeting service-level objectives. In a real testbed with production-grade servers supporting real services, NeuroScaler reduces energy consumption by 34.68% compared to the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) while maintaining target latency.

Abstract: We present MonkeyTree, the first system to mitigate network congestion in multi-tenant GPU clusters through job-migration based defragmentation rather than network-layer techniques. As cloud operators co-locate ML training jobs on shared, oversubscribed networks, congestion degrades training throughput for over a third of jobs. Prior approaches either rely on routing and flow scheduling--which we show have fundamental limits when traffic exceeds capacity--or require costly full-bisection bandwidth topologies with packet spraying.
  MonkeyTree exploits characteristics of ML training traffic: ring-based collectives generate exactly one cross-rack flow per rack a job spans, making congestion-free placements achievable. The sparse constraint structure admits abundant valid configurations, making them easy to reach with few migrations. Once reached, low fragmentation is self-reinforcing, as new arrivals disturb only a few racks. MonkeyTree formulates defragmentation as an integer linear program that minimizes worker movements, subject to per-rack fragmentation bounds. We prove a tight bound showing any placement can be defragmented to at most two cross-rack fragments per ToR, and extend the formulation to hybrid parallelism with multiple rings per server. Migration is implemented via in-memory checkpoint-and-restore over RDMA, incurring only 9.02 seconds of system overhead end-to-end per worker. We evaluate MonkeyTree using a custom simulator modeling clusters of up to 2,048 H200 GPUs and prototype on a five-node A100 testbed. MonkeyTree improves average job completion time by 14 percent over the next best baseline on a cluster of 1,024 GPUs with a 4:1 oversubscription. With a high 16:1 oversubscription ratio and 2,048 GPUs, MonkeyTree keeps p99 job completion time within 5 percent of ideal.

Abstract: Network traffic classification is a core primitive for network security and management, yet it is increasingly challenged by pervasive encryption and evolving protocols. A central bottleneck is representation: hand-crafted flow statistics are efficient but often too lossy, raw-bit encodings can be accurate but are costly, and recent pre-trained embeddings provide transfer but frequently flatten the protocol stack and entangle signals across layers. We observe that real traffic contains substantial redundancy both across network layers and within each layer; existing paradigms do not explicitly identify and remove this redundancy, leading to wasted capacity, shortcut learning, and degraded generalization. To address this, we propose PACC, a redundancy-aware, layer-aware representation framework. PACC treats the protocol stack as multi-view inputs and learns compact layer-wise projections that remain faithful to each layer while explicitly factorizing representations into shared (cross-layer) and private (layer-specific) components. We operationalize these goals with a joint objective that preserves layer-specific information via reconstruction, captures shared structure via contrastive mutual-information learning, and maximizes task-relevant information via supervised losses, yielding compact latents suitable for efficient inference. Across datasets covering encrypted application classification, IoT device identification, and intrusion detection, PACC consistently outperforms feature-engineered and raw-bit baselines. On encrypted subsets, it achieves up to a 12.9% accuracy improvement over nPrint. PACC matches or surpasses strong foundation-model baselines. At the same time, it improves end-to-end efficiency by up to 3.16x.

Abstract: Spatial Reuse (SR) is a cost-effective technique for improving spectral efficiency in dense IEEE 802.11 deployments by enabling simultaneous transmissions. However, the decentralized optimization of SR parameters -- transmission power and Carrier Sensing Threshold (CST) -- across different Basic Service Sets (BSSs) is challenging due to the lack of global state information. In addition, the concurrent operation of multiple agents creates a highly non-stationary environment, often resulting in suboptimal global configurations (e.g., using the maximum possible transmission power by default). To overcome these limitations, this paper introduces a decentralized learning algorithm based on regret-matching, grounded in internal regret minimization. Unlike standard decentralized ``selfish'' approaches that often converge to inefficient Nash Equilibria (NE), internal regret minimization guides competing agents toward Correlated Equilibria (CE), effectively mimicking coordination without explicit communication. Through simulation results, we showcase the superiority of our proposed approach and its ability to reach near-optimal global performance. These results confirm the not-yet-unleashed potential of scalable decentralized solutions and question the need for the heavy signaling overheads and architectural complexity associated with emerging centralized solutions like Multi-Access Point Coordination (MAPC).

Abstract: Multi-robot systems (MRS) rely on exchanging raw sensory data to cooperate in complex three-dimensional (3D) environments. However, this strategy often leads to severe communication congestion and high transmission latency, significantly degrading collaboration efficiency. This paper proposes a decentralized task-oriented semantic communication framework for multi-robot collaboration in unknown 3D environments. Each robot locally extracts compact, task-relevant semantics using a lightweight Pixel Difference Network (PiDiNet) with geometric processing. It shares only these semantic updates to build a task-sufficient 3D scene representation that supports cooperative perception, navigation, and object transport. Our numerical results show that the proposed method exhibits a dramatic reduction in communication overhead from $858.6$ Mb to $4.0$ Mb (over $200\times$ compression gain) while improving collaboration efficiency by shortening task completion from $1,054$ to $281$ steps.

Abstract: This paper introduces 6G-Bench, an open benchmark for evaluating semantic communication and network-level reasoning in AI-native 6G networks. 6G-Bench defines a taxonomy of 30 decision-making tasks (T1--T30) extracted from ongoing 6G and AI-agent standardization activities in 3GPP, IETF, ETSI, ITU-T, and the O-RAN Alliance, and organizes them into five standardization-aligned capability categories. Starting from 113,475 scenarios, we generate a balanced pool of 10,000 very-hard multiple-choice questions using task-conditioned prompts that enforce multi-step quantitative reasoning under uncertainty and worst-case regret minimization over multi-turn horizons. After automated filtering and expert human validation, 3,722 questions are retained as a high-confidence evaluation set, while the full pool is released to support training and fine-tuning of 6G-specialized models. Using 6G-Bench, we evaluate 22 foundation models spanning dense and mixture-of-experts architectures, short- and long-context designs (up to 1M tokens), and both open-weight and proprietary systems. Across models, deterministic single-shot accuracy (pass@1) spans a wide range from 0.22 to 0.82, highlighting substantial variation in semantic reasoning capability. Leading models achieve intent and policy reasoning accuracy in the range 0.87--0.89, while selective robustness analysis on reasoning-intensive tasks shows pass@5 values ranging from 0.20 to 0.91. To support open science and reproducibility, we release the 6G-Bench dataset on GitHub: https://github.com/maferrag/6G-Bench

Abstract: IPv6 dependability is increasingly inseparable from IPv6 security: Neighbor Discovery (ND), Router Advertisements (RA), and ICMPv6 are essential for correct operation yet expose a broad attack surface for spoofing and flooding. Meanwhile, IPv6's massive address space breaks per-IP reputation and makes many defenses either non-scalable or narrowly scoped (e.g., only internal threats, only RA abuse, or only volumetric floods). We propose a zero-trust edge architecture implemented in a single programmable data-plane pipeline that unifies four modules: external spoofing, internal spoofing, external flooding, and internal flooding. A key design choice is to enforce identity plausibility before rate plausibility: stateless per-packet validation filters spoofed traffic early so that time-window statistics for flooding operate on credible identities. We outline a concrete P4 design (prefix Hop-Limit bands, DAD-anchored address-port bindings, and Count-Min Sketch windowed counting) and evaluate it across a systematic 15-scenario suite spanning single-, dual-, and multi-vector compositions. We report results from a BMv2 prototype and validate the same pipeline on a Netronome NFP-4000 SmartNIC, and we discuss limitations and open directions.

Abstract: The proliferation of Multi-Radio Access Technology, Internet of Things devices, particularly Unmanned Aerial Vehicles operating across LoRaWAN, 5G/4G cellular, Meshtastic mesh, proprietary protocols such as DJI OcuSync, MAVLink telemetry links, Wi-Fi, and satellite, creates a fundamental and hitherto unexamined challenge for Zero Trust Architecture adoption. Each transition between radio access technologies constitutes a trust boundary crossing: the device exits one network trust domain and enters another, potentially invalidating authentication state, device attestation, and contextual trust signals. Current ZTA frameworks assume relatively stable network environments and do not address the trust implications of frequent, dynamic RAT switching in mobile IoT deployments.

Abstract: Efficient large-scale inference of transformer-based large language models (LLMs) remains a fundamental systems challenge, frequently requiring multi-GPU parallelism to meet stringent latency and throughput targets. Conventional tensor parallelism decomposes matrix operations across devices but introduces substantial inter-GPU synchronization, leading to communication bottlenecks and degraded scalability. We propose the Parallel Track (PT) Transformer, a novel architectural paradigm that restructures computation to minimize cross-device dependencies. PT achieves up to a 16x reduction in synchronization operations relative to standard tensor parallelism, while maintaining competitive model quality in our experiments. We integrate PT into two widely adopted LLM serving stacks-Tensor-RT-LLM and vLLM-and report consistent improvements in serving efficiency, including up to 15-30% reduced time to first token, 2-12% reduced time per output token, and up to 31.90% increased throughput in both settings.

Abstract: Modern distributed decision-making systems face significant challenges arising from data heterogeneity, dynamic environments, and the need for decentralized coordination. This paper introduces the Knowledge Sharing paradigm as an innovative approach that uses the semantic richness of Knowledge Graphs (KGs) and the representational power of Graph Embeddings (GEs) to achieve decentralized intelligence. Our architecture empowers individual nodes to locally construct semantic representations of their operational context, iteratively aggregating embeddings through neighbor-based exchanges using GraphSAGE. This iterative local aggregation process results in a dynamically evolving global semantic abstraction called Knowledge Map, enabling coordinated decision-making without centralized control. To validate our approach, we conduct extensive experiments under a distributed resource orchestration use case. We simulate different network topologies and node workloads, analyzing the local semantic drift of individual nodes. Experimental results confirm that our distributed knowledge-sharing mechanism effectively maintains semantic coherence and adaptability, making it suitable for complex and dynamic environments such as Edge Computing, IoT, and multi-agent systems.

Abstract: Distributed computing frameworks such as MapReduce have become essential for large-scale data processing by decomposing tasks across multiple nodes. The multi-access distributed computing (MADC) model further advances this paradigm by decoupling mapper and reducer roles: dedicated mapper nodes store data and compute intermediate values, while reducer nodes are connected to multiple mappers and aggregate results to compute final outputs. This separation reduces communication bottlenecks without requiring file replication. In this paper, we introduce privacy constraints into MADC and develop private coded schemes for two specific connectivity models. We construct new families of extended placement delivery arrays and derive corresponding coding schemes that guarantee privacy of each reducer's assigned function.

Abstract: Ensuring resilience in distributed systems has become an acute concern. In today's environment, it is crucial to develop light-weight mechanisms that recover a distributed system from faults quickly and with only a small impact on the live-system throughput. To address this need, this paper proposes a new low-overhead, general recovery scheme for modern non-transactional leaderless distributed systems. We call our scheme HEAL. On a node failure, HEAL performs an optimized online incremental recovery. This paper presents HEAL's algorithms for settings with Linearizable consistency and different memory persistency models. We implement HEAL on a 6-node Intel cluster. Our experiments running TAOBench workloads show that HEAL is very effective. HEAL recovers the cluster in 120 milliseconds on average, while reducing the throughput of the running workload by an average of 8.7%. In contrast, a conventional recovery scheme for leaderless systems needs 360 seconds to recover, reducing the throughput of the system by 16.2%. Finally, compared to an incremental recovery scheme for a state-of-the-art leader-based system, HEAL reduces the average recovery latency by 20.7x and the throughput degradation by 62.4%.

Abstract: Compute Express Link (CXL) 3.0 and beyond allows the compute nodes of a cluster to share data with hardware cache coherence and at the granularity of a cache line. This enables shared-memory semantics for distributed computing, but introduces new resilience challenges: a node failure leads to the loss of the dirty data in its caches, corrupting application state. Unfortunately, the CXL specification does not consider processor failures. Moreover, when a component fails, the specification tries to isolate it and continue application execution; there is no attempt to bring the application to a consistent state. To address these limitations, this paper extends the CXL specification to be resilient to node failures, and to correctly recover the application after node failures. We call the system ReCXL. To handle the failure of nodes, ReCXL augments the coherence transaction of a write with messages that propagate the update to a small set of other nodes (i.e., Replicas). Replicas save the update in a hardware Logging Unit. Such replication ensures resilience to node failures. Then, at regular intervals, the Logging Units dump the updates to memory. Recovery involves using the logs in the Logging Units to bring the directory and memory to a correct state. Our evaluation shows that ReCXL enables fault-tolerant execution with only a 30% slowdown over the same platform with no fault-tolerance support.

Abstract: Modern deep neural network (DNN) applications integrate multiple DNN models into inference pipelines with stringent latency requirements for customized tasks. To mitigate extensive request timeouts caused by accumulation, systems for inference pipelines commonly drop a subset of requests so the remaining ones can satisfy latency constraints. Since it is commonly believed that request dropping adversely affects goodput, existing systems only drop requests when they have to, which we call reactive dropping. However, this reactive policy can not maintain high goodput, as it neither makes timely dropping decisions nor identifies the proper set of requests to drop, leading to issues of dropping requests too late or dropping the wrong set of requests.
  We propose that the inference system should proactively drop certain requests in advance to enhance the goodput across the entire workload. To achieve this, we design an inference system PARD. It enhances goodput with timely and precise dropping decisions by integrating a proactive dropping method that decides when to drop requests using runtime information of the inference pipeline, and an adaptive request priority mechanism that selects which specific requests to drop based on remaining latency budgets and workload intensity. Evaluation on a cluster of 64 GPUs over real-world workloads shows that PARD achieves $16\%$-$176\%$ higher goodput than the state of the art while reducing the drop rate and wasted computation resources by $1.6\times$-$17\times$ and $1.5\times$-$62\times$ respectively.
