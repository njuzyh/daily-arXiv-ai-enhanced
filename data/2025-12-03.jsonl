Aim to submit to IEEE TCAD", "summary": "Software-defined radio (SDR) plays an important role in the communication field by providing a flexible and customized communication system for different purposes according to the needs. To enhance the performance of SDR applications, hardware accelerators have been widely deployed in recent years. In facing this obstacle, a necessity arises for a high-level synthesis (HLS) tool specifically designed for communication engineers without detailed hardware knowledge. To lower the barrier between SDR engineers and hardware development, this work proposed a Python-based HLS tool, VeriPy, which can generate both mainstream architecture for hardware accelerators in Verilog specifically for SDR designs including unrolled design and pipelined design, requiring no detailed digital hardware knowledge or Hardware Description Languages (HDL). Furthermore, VeriPy supports automatic testbench generation with random input stimulus, an extensible hardware library, performance and resource estimation, and offers strong optimisation potential at both the algorithmic and digital hardware levels. The generated hardware design by VeriPy can achieve up to 70% faster operating frequency compared to pragma-optimised Vivado HLS designs with a reasonably higher resource con-sumption while delivering comparable performance and resource consumption to hand-coded implementations. Regarding code complexity, VeriPy requires no pragmas, completely eliminating the need for low-level hardware knowledge. For straightforward algorithms, the input code length remains comparable to that of Vivado HLS."}

To this end, we adapt a distributed $k$-core algorithm originally proposed by Montresor et al. to shared-memory systems and implement it in Rust, leveraging the language's strengths in concurrency and memory safety. We developed three progressively optimized versions: SequentialK as a baseline, ParallelK introducing multi-threaded message passing, and FastK further reducing synchronization overhead. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets, including road networks, web graphs, and social networks, show that FastK consistently outperforms both SequentialK and ParallelK, as well as a reference Python implementation available in the NetworkX library.

With the advent of generative AI various attempts have been made to automate parts of the design and verification process. Large language models (LLMs) as well as specialized models generate hdl and testbenches for small components, having a few leaf level components. However, there are only a few attempts to automate the entire processor design process. Hardware design demands hierarchical and modular design processes. We utilized this best practice systematically and effectively. We propose agentic automated processor design and verification with engineers in the loop. The agent with optional specification tries to break down the design into sub-components, generate HDL and cocotb tests, and verifies the components involving engineer guidance, especially during debugging and synthesis. We designed various digital systems using this approach. However, we selected two simple processors for demonstration purposes in this work. The first one is a LEGv8 like a simple processor verified, synthesized and programmed for the DE-10 Lite FPGA. The second one is a RISC-V like 32-bit processor designed and verified in similar manner and synthesized. However, it is not programmed into the DE-10 Lite. This process is accomplished usually using around a million inference tokens per processor, using a combination of reasoning (e.g gemini-pro) and non-reasoning models (eg. gpt-5-mini) based on the complexity of the task. This indicates that hardware design and verification experimentation can be done cost effectively without using any specialized hardware. The approach is scalable, we even attempted system-on-chip, which we want to experiment in our future work."}

However, once a device model is widely deployed, the performance of each device becomes different after a period of running. This is caused by the differences in user configurations, environmental conditions, manufacturing variances, battery degradation, etc. Existing DNN compression methods have not taken this scenario into consideration and can not guarantee good compression results in all homogeneous edge devices. To address this, we propose Homogeneous-Device Aware Pruning (HDAP), a hardware-aware DNN compression framework explicitly designed for homogeneous edge devices, aiming to achieve optimal average performance of the compressed model across all devices. To deal with the difficulty of time-consuming hardware-aware evaluations for thousands or millions of homogeneous edge devices, HDAP partitions all the devices into several device clusters, which can dramatically reduce the number of devices to evaluate and use the surrogate-based evaluation instead of hardware evaluation in real-time. Extensive experiments on multiple device types (Jetson Xavier NX and Jetson Nano) and task types (image classification with ResNet50, MobileNetV1, ResNet56, VGG16; object detection with YOLOv8n) demonstrate that HDAP consistently achieves lower average latency and competitive accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods, with significant speedups (e.g., 2.86$\\times$ on ResNet50 at 1.0G FLOPs).

We present IslandRun, a multi-objective orchestration system that treats computational resources as autonomous \"islands\" spanning personal devices, private edge servers, and public cloud. Our key insights: (1) request-level heterogeneity demands policy-constrained multi-objective optimization, (2) data locality enables routing compute to data rather than data to compute, and (3) typed placeholder sanitization preserves context semantics across trust boundaries.

For example, a dishonest hotspot operator can intentionally violate the agreed upon connection terms in an attempt to increase their profits. In this paper, we examine and develop a taxonomy of adversarial behavior patterns in decentralized wireless networks.

Within this broader landscape, Verilog, as a representative hardware description language (HDL), plays a fundamental role in digital circuit design and verification, making its automated generation particularly significant for Electronic Design Automation (EDA). Consequently, recent research has increasingly focused on applying Large Language Models (LLMs) to Verilog code generation, particularly at the Register Transfer Level (RTL), exploring how these AI-driven techniques can be effectively integrated into hardware design workflows. Despite substantial research efforts have explored LLM applications in this domain, a comprehensive survey synthesizing these developments remains absent from the literature. This review fill addresses this gap by providing a systematic literature review of LLM-based methods for Verilog code generation, examining their effectiveness, limitations, and potential for advancing automated hardware design. The review encompasses research work from conferences and journals in the fields of SE, AI, and EDA, encompassing 70 papers published on venues, along with 32 high-quality preprint papers, bringing the total to 102 papers. By answering four key research questions, we aim to (1) identify the LLMs used for Verilog generation, (2) examine the datasets and metrics employed in evaluation, (3) categorize the techniques proposed for Verilog generation, and (4) analyze LLM alignment approaches for Verilog generation.

In a typical multi-server FL architecture, the regions covered by different edge servers (ESs) may overlap. Under this architecture, clients located in the overlapping areas can access edge models from multiple ESs. Building on this observation, we propose a cloud-free multi-server FL framework that leverages Overlapping Clients (OCs) as relays for inter-server model exchange while uploading the local updated model to ESs. This enables ES models to be relayed across multiple hops through neighboring ESs by OCs without introducing new communication links. We derive a new convergence upper bound for non-convex objectives under non-IID data and an arbitrary number of cells, which explicitly quantifies the impact of inter-server propagation depth on convergence error. Guided by this theoretical result, we formulate an optimization problem that aims to maximize dissemination range of each ES model among all ESs within a limited latency. To solve this problem, we develop a conflict-graph-based local search algorithm optimizing the routing strategy and scheduling the transmission times of individual ESs to its neighboring ESs. This enables ES models to be relayed across multiple hops through neighboring ESs by OCs, achieving the widest possible transmission coverage for each model without introducing new communication links. Extensive experimental results show remarkable performance gains of our scheme compared to existing methods."}

Phase-change memory (PCM) has gained attention as a promising option due to its scalability, fast access speeds, and zero leakage power compared to conventional memory systems. However, despite these advantages, PCM faces several challenges that impede its broader adoption, particularly its limited lifespan due to material degradation during write operations, as well as the high energy demands of these processes. For PCM to become a viable storage alternative, enhancing its endurance and reducing the energy required for write operations are essential. This paper proposes the use of a neural network (NN) model to predict critical parameters such as write latency, energy consumption, and endurance by monitoring real-time operating conditions and device characteristics. These predictions are key to improving PCM performance and identifying optimal write settings, making PCM a more practical and efficient option for data storage in applications with frequent write operations. Our approach leads to significant improvements, with NN predictions achieving a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 0.0073% for endurance, 0.23% for total write latency, and 4.92% for total write energy."}

Their runtime-dependent transition probabilities break down the pre-computation strategy that underpins most existing CPU and GPU static random walk optimizations. This leaves practitioners suffering from suboptimal frameworks and having to write hand-tuned kernels that do not adapt to workload diversity. To handle this issue, we present FlexiWalker, the first GPU framework that delivers efficient, workload-generic support for dynamic random walks. Our design-space study shows that rejection sampling and reservoir sampling are more suitable than other sampling techniques under massive parallelism. Thus, we devise (i) new high-performance kernels for them that eliminate global reductions, redundant memory accesses, and random-number generation. Given the necessity of choosing the best-fitting sampling strategy at runtime, we adopt (ii) a lightweight first-order cost model that selects the faster kernel per node at runtime. To enhance usability, we introduce (iii) a compile-time component that automatically specializes user-supplied walk logic into optimized building blocks. On various dynamic random walk workloads with real-world graphs, FlexiWalker outperforms the best published CPU/GPU baselines by geometric means of 73.44x and 5.91x, respectively, while successfully executing workloads that prior systems cannot support.

A growing number of such applications require a streamlined architecture for their effective execution, often comprising a single edge device with sensing capabilities, a single hub device (e.g., a laptop or smartphone) for managing and assisting the edge device, and a more computationally capable cloud server. Typical examples include the utilization of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) for critical infrastructure inspection or a wearable biomedical device (e.g., a smartwatch) for remote patient monitoring. Task allocation in this streamlined architecture is particularly challenging, due to the computational, communication, and energy limitations of the devices at the network edge. Consequently, there is a need for a comprehensive framework that can address the specific task allocation problem optimally and efficiently. To this end, we propose a complete, binary integer linear programming (BILP) based formulation for an application-driven design-time approach, capable of providing an optimal task allocation in the targeted edge/hub/cloud environment. The proposed method minimizes the desired objective, either the overall latency or overall energy consumption, while considering several crucial parameters and constraints often overlooked in related literature. We evaluate our framework using a real-world use-case scenario, as well as appropriate synthetic benchmarks. Our extensive experimentation reveals that the proposed approach yields optimal and scalable results, enabling efficient design space exploration for different applications and computational devices."}

This work presents an in-depth analysis of the impact of such faults on the computational pipeline of a Systolic Array based Deep Neural Network accelerator (SA-DNN accelerator) by means of a Register Transfer Level (RTL) Fault Injection (FI) simulation in order to improve the observability of each hardware block.

We present SIMPLE, a stage-agnostic, sequence-parallel, overlappable decision plane that disaggregates sampling into a CPU-side service and shrinks its runtime footprint back to a minor, hidden role. SIMPLE combines: (1) sequence-parallel sampling, which shards work along the batch dimension and removes vocabulary-axis collectives; (2) a CPU-based algorithm with column-wise penalties and truncation-first filtering to realize single-pass, linear-time kernels; and (3) speculative hot-vocab sampling (SHVS), which samples on a small hot set with rejection-correctness and uses a simple sizing model to choose the hot-vocab size that maximizes throughput.

Similarly to the push originating from the RISC-V movement for CPUs, Vortex can enable a myriad of fresh research directions for GPUs. However, as a young hardware platform, it currently lacks the performance competitiveness of commercial GPUs, which is crucial for widespread adoption. State-of-the-art GPUs, in fact, rely on complex architectural features, still unavailable in Vortex, to hide the micro-code overheads linked to control flow (CF) management and memory orchestration for data access. In particular, these components account for the majority of the dynamic instruction count in regular, memory-intensive kernels, such as linear algebra routines, which form the basis of many applications, including Machine Learning. To address these challenges with simple yet powerful micro-architecture modifications, this paper introduces decoupled CF and data access through 1.) a hardware CF manager to accelerate branching and predication in regular loop execution and 2.) decoupled memory streaming lanes to further hide memory latency with useful computation. The evaluation results for different kernels show 8$\\times$ faster execution, 10$\\times$ reduction in dynamic instruction count, and overall performance improvement from 0.35 to 1.63 $\\mathrm{GFLOP/s/mm^2}$. Thanks to these enhancements, Vortex can become an ideal playground to enable GPGPU research for the next generation of Machine Learning."}

Optimally allocating users to slices is a constrained optimization problem that traditionally requires complex algorithms. In this paper, we explore the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to tackle radio resource allocation for network slicing. We focus on two approaches: (1) using an LLM in a zero-shot setting to directly assign user service requests to slices, and (2) formulating an integer programming model where the LLM provides semantic insight by estimating similarity between requests. Our experiments show that an LLM, even with zero-shot prompting, can produce a reasonable first draft of slice assignments, although it may violate some capacity or latency constraints. We then incorporate the LLM's understanding of service requirements into an optimization solver to generate an improved allocation. The results demonstrate that LLM-guided grouping of requests, based on minimal textual input, achieves performance comparable to traditional methods that use detailed numerical data, in terms of resource utilization and slice isolation. While the LLM alone does not perfectly satisfy all constraints, it significantly reduces the search space and, when combined with exact solvers, provides a promising approach for efficient 5G network slicing resource allocation."}

This paper presents Tangram, a novel system that accelerates Serverless LLM loading through efficient GPU memory reuse. By leveraging the unused GPU memory to retain model parameters, Tangram significantly reduces model transfer time and cold-start latency.

We present LIMA, a protocol for augmenting an existing or new LoRaWAN deployment with a mesh network of LIMA Routers. LIMA increases the effective coverage range well beyond the maximum LoRa range via multi-hopping, and significantly reduces the energy consumed by end-devices. LIMA requires no changes to the end-device, the servers or the LoRaWAN standard. LIMA builds routes using reverse path forwarding, tunnels LoRaWAN messages over LIMA, provides transparent extension of the existing Adaptive Data Rate (ADR), and suppresses duplicate forwarding if the device is directly reachable from the Gateway. Simulations using Network Simulator 3 (ns-3) show that LIMA increases the delivery rate, scalability, ED energy consumption by up to 5x, 8x and 12.6x respectively, and reduces latency by up to 2.3x.

As FPGA designs scale and heterogeneous resources increase, dense interconnects introduce significant resistive and capacitive effects, making timing closure increasingly difficult. Existing methods face challenges in constructing accurate timing models due to multi-factor nonlinear constraints as well as load and crosstalk coupling effects arising in multi-pin driving scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose TD-Placer, a critical path aware, timing-driven global placement framework. It leverages graph-based representations to capture global net interactions and employs a nonlinear model to integrate diverse timing-related features for precise delay prediction, thereby improving the overall placement quality for FPGAs. TD-Placer adopts a quadratic placement objective that minimizes wirelength while incorporating a timing term constructed by a lightweight algorithm, enabling efficient and high-quality timing optimization. Regarding net-level timing contention, it also employs a finer-grained weighting scheme to facilitate smooth reduction of the Critical Path Delay (CPD). Extensive experiments were carried out on seven real-world open-source FPGA projects with LUT counts ranging from 60K to 400K. The results demonstrate that TD-Placer achieves an average 10% improvement in Worst Negative Slack (WNS) and a 5% reduction in CPD compared to the state-of-the-art method, with an average CPD comparable (*1.01) to the commercial AMD Vivado across five versions (2020.2-2024.2).

Additionally, there are few options to deploy Learning workloads in the edge as part of a larger application using a declarative approach such as Kubernetes manifests. This paper proposes Delta Sum Learning as a method to improve the basic aggregation operation in Gossip Learning, and implements it in a decentralized orchestration framework based on Open Application Model, which allows for dynamic node discovery and intent-driven deployment of multi-workload applications. Evaluation results show that Delta Sum performance is on par with alternative integration methods for 10 node topologies, but results in a 58% lower global accuracy drop when scaling to 50 nodes.

A growing number of such applications require a streamlined architecture for their effective execution, often comprising a single edge device with sensing capabilities, a single hub device (e.g., a laptop or smartphone) for managing and assisting the edge device, and a more computationally capable cloud server. Typical examples include the utilization of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) for critical infrastructure inspection or a wearable biomedical device (e.g., a smartwatch) for remote patient monitoring. Task allocation in this streamlined architecture is particularly challenging, due to the computational, communication, and energy limitations of the devices at the network edge. Consequently, there is a need for a comprehensive framework that can address the specific task allocation problem optimally and efficiently. To this end, we propose a complete, binary integer linear programming (BILP) based formulation for an application-driven design-time approach, capable of providing an optimal task allocation in the targeted edge/hub/cloud environment. The proposed method minimizes the desired objective, either the overall latency or overall energy consumption, while considering several crucial parameters and constraints often overlooked in related literature.

B-splines prove particularly challenging to accelerate due to their recursive definition.

Handling these parameters efficiently in traditional accelerators is limited by data-transmission bottlenecks, motivating Compute-in-Memory (CiM) architectures that integrate computation within or near memory to reduce data movement. Recent work has explored CiM designs using Floating-Point (FP) and Integer (INT) operations. FP computations typically deliver higher output quality due to their wider dynamic range and precision, benefiting precision-sensitive Generative AI applications. These include models such as LLMs, thus driving advancements in FP-CiM accelerators. However, the vulnerability of FP-CiM to hardware faults remains underexplored, posing a major reliability concern in mission-critical settings. To address this gap, we systematically analyze hardware fault effects in FP-CiM by introducing bit-flip faults at key computational stages, including digital multipliers, CiM memory cells, and digital adder trees. Experiments with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) such as AlexNet and state-of-the-art LLMs including LLaMA-3.2-1B and Qwen-0.3B-Base reveal how faults at each stage affect inference accuracy. Notably, a single adder fault can reduce LLM accuracy to 0%. Based on these insights, we propose a fault-resilient design, SafeCiM, that mitigates fault impact far better than a naive FP-CiM with a pre-alignment stage. For example, with 4096 MAC units, SafeCiM reduces accuracy degradation by up to 49x for a single adder fault compared to the baseline FP-CiM architecture."}

Yet today's networking architectures, built on complete decoupling of the applications and the network, cannot expose or exploit high-level goals, limiting their ability to adapt intelligently to service needs. This work introduces Goal-Oriented Multi-Agent Semantic Networking (GoAgentNet), a new architecture that elevates communication from data exchange to goal fulfilment. GoAgentNet enables applications and the network to collaborate by abstracting their functions into multiple collaborative agents, and jointly orchestrates multi-agent sensing, networking, computation, and control through semantic computation and cross-layer semantic networking, allowing the entire architecture to pursue unified application goals. We first outline the limitations of legacy network designs in supporting 6G services, based on which we highlight key enablers of our GoAgentNet design. Then, through three representative 6G usage scenarios, we demonstrate how GoAgentNet can unlock more efficient and intelligent services. We further identify unique challenges faced by GoAgentNet deployment and corresponding potential solutions. A case study on robotic fault detection and recovery shows that our GoAgentNet architecture improves energy efficiency by up to 99% and increases the task success rate by up to 72%, compared with the existing networking architectures without GoAgentNet, which underscores its potential to support scalable and sustainable 6G systems."}

LLaMCAT combines Miss Status Holding Register (MSHR)- and load balance-aware cache arbitration with thread throttling to address stringent bandwidth demands and minimize cache stalls in KV Cache access. We also propose a hybrid simulation framework integrating analytical models with cycle-level simulators via memory traces, balancing architecture detail and efficiency.\n  Experiments demonstrate that LLaMCAT achieves an average speedup of 1.26x when the system is mainly bottlenecked by miss handling throughput, while baselines mostly show negative improvements since they are not optimized for this scenario. When the cache size is also limited, our policy achieves a speedup of 1.58x over the unoptimized version, and a 1.26x improvement over the best baseline (dyncta).

This paper investigates the physical-layer impact of two types of narrowband signals (BPSK and GMSK) on LoRa demodulation. We employ symbol-level Monte Carlo simulations to analyse how the interference-to-noise ratio (INR) affects the symbol error rate (SER) at a given signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and noise floor, and then compare the results with those for additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) of equal power. We demonstrate that modelling narrowband interference as additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) systematically overestimates the SER of Chirp Spread Spectrum (CSS) demodulation. We also clarify the distinct impairment levels induced by AWGN and two types of narrowband interferers, and provide physical insight into the underlying mechanisms.

Because it occupies over half of the chip area, cache memory is highly susceptible to transient and permanent faults, posing reliability challenges. As the only hardware-managed memory module, the cache tag array is the most active and critical component, dominating both energy usage and error rate. Tag partitioning is a widely used technique to reduce tag-access energy and enhance reliability. It divides tag comparison into two phases: first comparing the k lower bits, and then activating only the matching tag entries to compare the remaining higher bits. The key design parameter is the selection of the tag-splitting point k, which determines how many reads are eliminated. However, prior studies have chosen k intuitively, randomly, or empirically, without justification. Even experimentally determined values are ad-hoc and do not generalize across cache configurations due to high sensitivity to architectural parameters.\n  In this paper, we analytically show that choosing k too large or too small substantially reduces the effectiveness of tag partitioning. We then derive a formulation that determines the optimal splitting point based on cache configuration parameters. The formulation is convex, differentiable, and capable of precisely quantifying tag-partitioning efficiency for any k and configuration. To validate our model, we experimentally evaluate tag-partitioning efficiency and optimal k across a broad set of cache designs and demonstrate close agreement between analytical and experimental results. The proposed formulation enables designers and researchers to instantly compute the optimal tag-splitting point and accurately estimate tag-read reduction."}

Specifically, vehicles need to exchange information with the road side unit (RSU). However, due to the varying vehicle speeds leading to different communication durations, the amount of data exchanged between different vehicles and the RSU may vary. This may poses significant safety risks in high-speed environments. To address this, we define a fairness index through tuning the selection window of different vehicles and consider the image semantic communication system to reduce latency. However, adjusting the selection window may affect the communication time, thereby impacting the AoI. Moreover, considering the re-evaluation mechanism in 5G NR, which helps reduce resource collisions, it may lead to an increase in AoI. We analyze the AoI using Stochastic Hybrid System (SHS) and construct a multi-objective optimization problem to achieve fair access and AoI optimization. Sequential Convex Approximation (SCA) is employed to transform the non-convex problem into a convex one, and solve it using convex optimization. We also provide a large language model (LLM) based algorithm. The scheme's effectiveness is validated through numerical simulations."}

This work addresses this gap by proposing a software framework that enhances routing flexibility by dynamically incorporating application-aware decisions. The core of the work establishes a multi-hop Wi-Fi network of heterogeneous devices, specifically ESP8266, ESP32, and Raspberry Pi 3B. The routing layer follows a proactive approach, while the network is fault-tolerant, maintaining operation despite both node loss and message loss. On top of this, a middleware layer introduces three strategies for influencing routing behavior: two adapt the path a message traverses until arriving at the destination, while the third allows applications to shape the network topology. This layer offers a flexible interface for diverse applications. The framework was validated on a physical testbed through edge intelligence use cases, including distributing neural network inference computations across multiple devices and offloading the entire workload to the most capable node. Distributed inference is useful in scenarios requiring low latency, energy efficiency, privacy, and autonomy. Experimental results indicated that device heterogeneity significantly impacts network performance. Throughput and inference duration analysis showed the influence of the strategies on application behaviour, revealed that topology critically affects decentralized performance, and demonstrated the suitability of the framework for complex tasks."}

VP numbers cover a larger dynamic range than fixed-point numbers with similar bitwidth, without notably increasing hardware complexity -- this allows for a more efficient representation of signals with high dynamic range. To demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed VP number format, we consider a matrix-vector multiplication engine for spatial equalization in multi-antenna wireless communication systems involving high-dynamic-range signals. Through post-layout VLSI implementation results, we demonstrate that the proposed VP-based design achieves 20% and 10% area and power savings, respectively, compared to a fully optimized fixed-point design, without incurring any noticeable performance degradation."}

Complete cross-compilation is often unfeasible due to ISA-specific code or missing dependencies, leaving programs with high emulation overhead.\n  We propose a hybrid execution system that combines compilation and emulation, featuring a selective function offloading mechanism. This mechanism establishes cross-environment calling channels, offloading eligible functions to the host for native execution to reduce DBT overhead. Key optimizations address offloading costs, enabling efficient hybrid operation. Built on LLVM and QEMU, the system works automatically for both applications and libraries. Evaluations show it achieves up to 13x speedups over existing DBT, with strong practical value."}

Source code available at https://github.com/TimeATronics/wasm_cpu", "summary": "Soft-core processors on resource-constrained FPGAs often suffer from low code density and reliance on proprietary toolchains. This paper details the design, implementation, and evaluation of a 32-bit dual-stack microprocessor architecture optimized for low-cost, resource-constrained Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). Implemented on the Gowin GW1NR-9 (Tang Nano 9K), the processor utilizes an instruction set architecture (ISA) inspired from a subset of the WebAssembly (WASM) specification to achieve high code density. Unlike traditional soft-cores that often rely on proprietary vendor toolchains and opaque IP blocks, this design is synthesized and routed utilizing an open-source flow, providing transparency and portability. The architecture features a dual-stack model (Data and Return), executing directly from SPI Flash via an Execute-in-Place (XIP) mechanism to conserve scarce Block RAM on the intended target device. An analysis of the trade-offs involved in stack depth parametrization is presented, demonstrating that an 8-entry distributed RAM implementation provides a balance between logic resource utilization ($\\sim 80\\%$) and routing congestion. Furthermore, timing hazards in single-cycle stack operations are identified and resolved through a refined Finite State Machine (FSM) design. The system achieves a stable operating frequency of 27 MHz, limited by Flash latency, and successfully executes simple applications including a single and multi-digit infix calculator."}

However, existing designs suffer from memristor access overhead due to the large number of graph partitions. This leads to increased execution time, higher energy consumption, and re-duced circuit lifetime. This paper proposes a graph processing method that minimizes memristor write operations by identifying frequent subgraph patterns and assigning them to graph engines, referred to as static, allowing most subgraphs to be processed without a need for crossbar reconfiguration. Experimental results show speed up to 2.38x speedup and 7.23x energy savings com-pared to state-of-the-art accelerators. Furthermore, our method extends the circuit lifetime by 2x compared to state-of-the-art ReRAM graph accelerators."}

Preserving this fine granularity necessitated the introduction of bank groups and pseudo channels. These structures expand timing parameters and control overhead, significantly increasing memory controller scheduling complexity. Large language models (LLMs) now dominate deep learning workloads, streaming contiguous data blocks ranging from several kilobytes to megabytes per operation. In a conventional HBM-based memory system, these transfers are fragmented into hundreds of 32B cache line transactions. This forces the memory controller to employ unnecessarily intricate scheduling, leading to growing inefficiency.\n  To address this problem, we propose RoMe. RoMe accesses DRAM at row granularity and removes columns, bank groups, and pseudo channels from the memory interface. This design simplifies memory scheduling, thereby requiring fewer pins per channel. The freed pins are aggregated to form additional channels, increasing overall bandwidth by 12.5% with minimal extra pins. RoMe demonstrates how memory scheduling logic can be significantly simplified for representative LLM workloads, and presents an alternative approach for next-generation HBM-based memory systems achieving increased bandwidth with minimal hardware overhead."}

However, cold-start latency, especially the model loading phase, has become a critical performance bottleneck, as it scales linearly with model size and severely limits the practical deployment of large-scale LLM services. This paper presents Tangram, a novel system that accelerates Serverless LLM loading through efficient GPU memory reuse. By leveraging the unused GPU memory to retain model parameters, Tangram significantly reduces model transfer time and cold-start latency. Its design includes three key components: unified GPU memory pool for tensor-level parameter sharing across models, on-demand KV cache allocation for dynamic memory management, and GPU-affinity-aware scheduling for maximizing resource utilization. These techniques collectively address the critical challenges of inefficient memory usage and the cold-start problem in Serverless LLM platforms. We have implemented a fully functional prototype, and experiments show that Tangram achieves up to 6.2 times faster loading and reduces Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) during cold-start by 23--55% over state-of-the-art methods."}
