Existing latency-assessment methodologies focus predominantly on Glass-to-Glass (G2G) latency, defined as the delay between an event occurring in the operational environment, its capture by a camera, and its subsequent display to the remote operator. However, G2G latency accounts for only one component of the total delay experienced by the driver. The complementary component, Motion-to-Motion (M2M) latency, represents the delay between the initiation of a control input by the remote driver and the corresponding physical actuation by the vehicle. Together, M2M and G2G constitute the overall End-to-End (E2E) latency. This paper introduces a measurement framework capable of quantifying M2M, G2G, and E2E latencies using gyroscopes, a phototransistor, and two GPS-synchronized Raspberry Pi 5 units. The system employs low-pass filtering and threshold-based detection to identify steering-wheel motion on both the remote operator and vehicle sides. An interrupt is generated when the phototransistor detects the activation of an LED positioned within the camera's Field Of View (FOV). Initial measurements obtained from our teleoperated prototype vehicle over commercial 4G and 5G networks indicate an average E2E latency of approximately 500 ms (measurement precision +/- 4 ms). The M2M latency contributes up to 60% of this value."}

In such scenarios, voice radio communications remain essential for first responders due to their robustness; however, their unstructured nature prevents direct integration with automated UAV-assisted network management. This paper proposes SIREN, an AI-driven framework that enables voice-driven perception for UAV-assisted networks. By integrating Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) with Large Language Model (LLM)-based semantic extraction and Natural Language Processing (NLP) validation, SIREN converts emergency voice traffic into structured, machine-readable information, including responding units, location references, emergency severity, and Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements. SIREN is evaluated using synthetic emergency scenarios with controlled variations in language, speaker count, background noise, and message complexity. The results demonstrate robust transcription and reliable semantic extraction across diverse operating conditions, while highlighting speaker diarization and geographic ambiguity as the main limiting factors. These findings establish the feasibility of voice-driven situational awareness for UAV-assisted networks and show a practical foundation for human-in-the-loop decision support and adaptive network management in emergency response operations."}

By integrating domain-specific prompt engineering including In-Context Learning (ICL), Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, and a multi-round feedback-verification flow, SimulatorCoder systematically transforms high-level functional requirements into efficient, executable, and architecture-aligned simulator code. Experiments based on the customized SCALE-Sim benchmark demonstrate that structured prompting and feedback mechanisms substantially improve both code generation accuracy and simulator performance. The resulting simulators not only maintain cycle-level fidelity with less than 1% error compared to manually implemented counterparts, but also consistently achieve lower simulation runtimes, highlighting the effectiveness of LLM-based methods in accelerating simulator development. Our code is available at https://github.com/xiayuhuan/SimulatorCoder."}

In many formal settings, such as circuit specifications, examinations, and hardware documentation, operators and components are explicitly redefined within narrow scope. Correct reasoning in these contexts requires models to temporarily suppress globally learned conventions in favor of prompt-local definitions. In this work, we study a systematic failure mode we term semantic override, in which an LLM reverts to its pretrained default interpretation of operators or gate behavior despite explicit redefinition in the prompt. We also identify a related class of errors, assumption injection, where models commit to unstated hardware semantics when critical details are underspecified, rather than requesting clarification. We introduce a compact micro-benchmark of 30 logic and digital-circuit reasoning tasks designed as verifier-style traps, spanning Boolean algebra, operator overloading, redefined gates, and circuit-level semantics. Evaluating three frontier LLMs, we observe persistent noncompliance with local specifications, confident but incompatible assumptions, and dropped constraints even in elementary settings. Our findings highlight a gap between surface-level correctness and specification-faithful reasoning, motivating evaluation protocols that explicitly test local unlearning and semantic compliance in formal domains."}
