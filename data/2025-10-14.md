### [1] [Fine-grained CDN Delegation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09983)
*Ethan Thompson,Ali Sadeghi Jahromi,AbdelRahman Abdou*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: Delegation Certificates (DeCerts) 是一种基于X.509证书标准修改的新型CDN委托解决方案，允许域名所有者独立于CA进行细粒度委托管理，提供更好的安全性和灵活性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前CDN委托解决方案（如RFC 9345）缺乏对委托链长度、撤销机制、允许操作等关键方面的细粒度定义，需要更灵活的委托管理方案。

Method: 修改X.509证书标准并添加新扩展，使域名所有者能够指定委托和非委托子域名，控制委托深度，并实现完全独立于CA的证书颁发。通过修改Firefox浏览器进行概念验证。

Result: DeCerts成功实现了细粒度CDN委托，提供了多种撤销机制平衡安全性和性能，与浏览器和TLS/HTTPS协议兼容，增强了CDN委托的安全性、可扩展性和可管理性。

Conclusion: DeCerts为互联网服务提供了一种实用的CDN委托解决方案，通过赋予域名所有者完全自主权，显著提升了委托管理的灵活性和安全性。

Abstract: The use of Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) has significantly increased over
the past decade, with approximately 55 million websites currently relying on
CDN services. Emerging solutions, such as Delegated Credentials (RFC 9345),
lack fine-grained definitions of many critical aspects of delegation, such as
the length of delegation chains, revocation mechanism, permitted operations,
and a well-defined scope for said delegation. We present Delegation
Certificates (DeCerts), which modify X.509 certificate standard and add new
extensions to enable fine-grained CDN delegation. DeCerts allow domain owners
to specify delegated and non-delegated subdomains, and control the depth of
delegation extended by CDNs, which provides flexibility in delegation
management. But more importantly, DeCerts are built on a new principle which
provides full autonomy to domain owners-domain owners can issue DeCerts fully
independent of Certificate Authorities (CAs), and thus have greater flexibility
in policy control, including revocation methods. Such level of flexibility
would be hard to match if CAs where to issue such certificates. Revoking a
DeCert revokes delegation. We discuss multiple revocation mechanisms for a
DeCerts balancing security, performance, and delegator control. We modify
Firefox to support DeCert (i.e., proper validation) as a proof-of-concept, and
test it to demonstrate the feasibility, compatibility of DeCerts with browsers
and TLS/HTTPS protocols. DeCerts enhance the security, scalability, and
manageability of CDN delegation, offering a practical solution for Internet
services.

### [2] [Pushing the Boundaries in CBRS Band: Robust Radar Detection within High 5G Interference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10040)
*Shafi Ullah Khan,Michel Kulhandjian,Debashri Roy*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 该论文研究了基于机器学习的方法在CBRS频段增强频谱共享能力，特别是商业5G信号与军用雷达系统共存的问题。研究表明ML技术可以显著扩展FCC推荐的SINR边界，在-5dB高干扰环境下实现99%的雷达检测精度，并能以93%的准确率识别六种雷达波形类型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 频谱共享是满足日益增长的用户需求的关键策略，但在与现有系统（如军用通信）共存方面的有效监管和技术实现仍面临重大挑战。需要解决商业无线服务与关键任务操作之间的共存问题。

Method: 采用基于机器学习的方法，利用同相/正交(IQ)数据和频谱图，在CBRS频段进行雷达检测和波形识别。通过合成和真实世界信号的严格评估，验证ML模型在高干扰环境下的性能。

Result: ML模型在-5dB SINR的高干扰环境下实现了FCC推荐的99%雷达检测精度，显著扩展了SINR边界（从约12dB降至-5dB）。同时能够以93%的准确率分类六种不同的雷达波形类型。

Conclusion: 机器学习技术能够有效增强频谱共享能力，特别是在高干扰环境下改善雷达检测和波形识别性能，为商业无线服务与关键任务系统的共存提供了可行的技术解决方案。

Abstract: Spectrum sharing is a critical strategy for meeting escalating user demands
via commercial wireless services, yet its effective regulation and
technological enablement, particularly concerning coexistence with incumbent
systems, remain significant challenges. Federal organizations have established
regulatory frameworks to manage shared commercial use alongside
mission-critical operations, such as military communications. This paper
investigates the potential of machine learning (ML)-based approaches to enhance
spectrum sharing capabilities within the Citizens Broadband Radio Service
(CBRS) band, specifically focusing on the coexistence of commercial signals
(e.g., 5G) and military radar systems. We demonstrate that ML techniques can
potentially extend the Federal Communications Commission (FCC)-recommended
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) boundaries by improving radar
detection and waveform identification in high-interference environments.
Through rigorous evaluation using both synthetic and real-world signals, our
findings indicate that proposed ML models, utilizing In-phase/Quadrature (IQ)
data and spectrograms, can achieve the FCC-recommended $99\%$ radar detection
accuracy even when subjected to high interference from 5G signals upto -5dB
SINR, exceeding the required limits of $20$ SINR. Our experimental studies
distinguish this work from the state-of-the-art by significantly extending the
SINR limit for $99\%$ radar detection accuracy from approximately $12$ dB down
to $-5$ dB. Subsequent to detection, we further apply ML to analyze and
identify radar waveforms. The proposed models also demonstrate the capability
to classify six distinct radar waveform types with $93\%$ accuracy.

*Rahul Vanukuri,Shafi Ullah Khan,Talip Tolga Sarı,Gokhan Secinti,Diego Patiño,Debashri Roy*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于扩散模型的生成方法，用于合成CBRS频段中LTE、5G和雷达信号的多样化频谱图，以解决雷达信号数据稀缺问题，并通过实验证明生成数据能显著提升雷达检测任务的训练效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在CBRS等共享频段中，有效的频谱管理和干扰抑制需要强大的雷达检测算法来保护军事传输免受商业无线传输的干扰。然而，雷达信号罕见且出现频率低，导致收集和标注真实世界射频频谱图数据困难，限制了AI模型的性能和泛化能力。

Method: 提出一种基于扩散的生成模型，用于合成CBRS频段中五种不同类别（整合LTE、5G和雷达信号）的真实且多样化的频谱图。使用结构相似性指数（SSIM）和峰值信噪比（PSNR）等广泛接受的评估指标对生成的频谱图进行结构和统计保真度分析。

Result: 生成数据与训练数据的差异通过SSIM和PSNR指标进行量化。实验表明，在生成的频谱图上进行预训练能显著提高真实世界雷达检测任务的训练效率，实现51.5%的更快收敛速度。

Conclusion: 扩散生成模型能有效解决雷达信号数据稀缺问题，合成的频谱图具有高保真度，并能显著提升AI模型在雷达检测任务中的训练效率和性能。

Abstract: The growing demand for effective spectrum management and interference
mitigation in shared bands, such as the Citizens Broadband Radio Service
(CBRS), requires robust radar detection algorithms to protect the military
transmission from interference due to commercial wireless transmission. These
algorithms, in turn, depend on large, diverse, and carefully labeled
spectrogram datasets. However, collecting and annotating real-world radio
frequency (RF) spectrogram data remains a significant challenge, as radar
signals are rare, and their occurrences are infrequent. This challenge makes
the creation of balanced datasets difficult, limiting the performance and
generalizability of AI models in this domain.
  To address this critical issue, we propose a diffusion-based generative model
for synthesizing realistic and diverse spectrograms of five distinct categories
that integrate LTE, 5G, and radar signals within the CBRS band. We conduct a
structural and statistical fidelity analysis of the generated spectrograms
using widely accepted evaluation metrics Structural Similarity Index Measure
(SSIM) and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), to quantify their divergence from
the training data. Furthermore, we demonstrate that pre-training on the
generated spectrograms significantly improves training efficiency on a
real-world radar detection task by enabling $51.5\%$ faster convergence.

Abstract: Operating at petabit-scale, ByteDance's cloud gateways are deployed at
critical aggregation points to orchestrate a wide array of business traffic.
However, this massive scale imposes significant resource pressure on our
previous-generation cloud gateways, rendering them unsustainable in the face of
ever-growing cloud-network traffic. As the DPU market rapidly expands, we see a
promising path to meet our escalating business traffic demands by integrating
DPUs with our established Tofino-based gateways. DPUs augment these gateways
with substantially larger table capacities and richer programmability without
compromising previously low-latency and high-throughput forwarding. Despite
compelling advantages, the practical integration of DPUs into cloud gateways
remains unexplored, primarily due to underlying challenges. In this paper, we
present Zephyrus, a production-scale gateway built upon a unified P4 pipeline
spanning high-performance Tofino and feature-rich DPUs, which successfully
overcomes these challenges. We further introduce a hierarchical co-offloading
architecture (HLCO) to orchestrate traffic flow within this heterogeneous
gateway, achieving > 99% hardware offloading while retaining software fallback
paths for complex operations. Zephyrus outperforms LuoShen (NSDI '24) with 33%
higher throughput and our evaluation further indicates 21% lower power
consumption and 14% lower hardware cost. Against FPGA-based systems, Albatross
(SIGCOMM '25), it doubles the throughput at a substantially lower Total Cost of
Ownership (TCO), showcasing its superior performance-per-dollar. Beyond these
performance gains, we also share key lessons from several years of developing
and operating Zephyrus at production scale. We believe these insights provide
valuable references for researchers and practitioners designing performant
cloud gateways.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The increase of bandwidth-intensive applications in sixth-generation (6G)
wireless networks, such as real-time volumetric streaming and multi-sensory
extended reality, demands intelligent multicast routing solutions capable of
delivering differentiated quality-of-service (QoS) at scale. Traditional
shortest-path and multicast routing algorithms are either computationally
prohibitive or structurally rigid, and they often fail to support heterogeneous
user demands, leading to suboptimal resource utilization. Neural network-based
approaches, while offering improved inference speed, typically lack topological
generalization and scalability. To address these limitations, this paper
presents a graph neural network (GNN)-based multicast routing framework that
jointly minimizes total transmission cost and supports user-specific video
quality requirements. The routing problem is formulated as a constrained
minimum-flow optimization task, and a reinforcement learning algorithm is
developed to sequentially construct efficient multicast trees by reusing paths
and adapting to network dynamics. A graph attention network (GAT) is employed
as the encoder to extract context-aware node embeddings, while a long
short-term memory (LSTM) module models the sequential dependencies in routing
decisions. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed method closely
approximates optimal dynamic programming-based solutions while significantly
reducing computational complexity. The results also confirm strong
generalization to large-scale and dynamic network topologies, highlighting the
method's potential for real-time deployment in 6G multimedia delivery
scenarios. Code is available at https://github.com/UNIC-Lab/GNN-Routing.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The advent of the fifth-generation technology promises to bring about more
vertical applications and emerging services that include vehicular networks and
intelligent transportation systems (ITSs). To achieve their vision of real-time
and safetyapplications, vehicular networks rely on short-range to medium-range
communications. One emerging technology that aims to provide reliability and
high-data rate in short-range communications is the visible light
communications (VLC). Due to its remarkable advantages, some studies have
recently investigated the integration of VLC in vehicular networks and ITSs.
Despite their attractive features, such networks also face several
implementation issues. This paper provides an extended tutorial on the
implementation of VLC-based vehicular networks. To begin with, we present the
implementation characteristics of these systems and discuss some related
issues. The underlying system considers a general structure with transmitters,
channels, and receivers based on photodetectors and cameras, as well as
standardization efforts and types of topologies. In addition, we discuss the
impact of the sun and artificial light sources, flickering, dimming, throughput
enhancement, uplink security, and mobility on practical implementation.
Finally, we highlight some key challenges and potential solutions and provide
some directions for future research investigations that could constitute an
advancement toward the development of commercial VLC-based vehicular systems.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: This study investigates a cognitive shared access network with energy
harvesting capabilities operating under Age of Information (AoI) constraints
for the primary user. Secondary transmitters are spatially distributed
according to a homogeneous Poisson Point Process (PPP), while the primary user
is located at a fixed position. The primary transmitter handles bursty packet
arrivals, whereas secondary users operate under saturated traffic conditions.
To manage interference and energy, two distinct zones are introduced: an energy
harvesting zone around the primary transmitter and a guard zone around the
primary receiver, within which secondary transmissions are prohibited.
Secondary users access the channel probabilistically, with access decisions
depending on their current battery state (charged or empty) and their location
relative to the guard zone. Our objective is to analyze the primary user's AoI
performance under three distinct packet management policies.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) chatbots are now pervasive in digital ecosystems, yet
their network traffic remains largely underexplored. This study presents an
in-depth investigation of traffic generated by three leading chatbots (ChatGPT,
Copilot, and Gemini) when accessed via Android mobile apps for both text and
image generation. Using a dedicated capture architecture, we collect and label
two complementary workloads: a 60-hour generic dataset with unconstrained
prompts, and a controlled dataset built from identical prompts across GenAI
apps and replicated via conventional messaging apps to enable one-to-one
comparisons. This dual design allows us to address practical research questions
on the distinctiveness of GenAI traffic, its differences from widely deployed
traffic categories, and its novel implications for network usage. To this end,
we provide fine-grained traffic characterization at trace, flow, and protocol
levels, and model packet-sequence dynamics with Multimodal Markov Chains. Our
analyses reveal app- and content-specific traffic patterns, particularly in
volume, uplink/downlink profiles, and protocol adoption. We highlight the
predominance of TLS, with Gemini extensively leveraging QUIC, ChatGPT
exclusively using TLS 1.3, and app- and content-specific Server Name Indication
(SNI) values. A payload-based occlusion analysis quantifies SNI's contribution
to classification: masking it reduces F1-score by up to 20 percentage points in
GenAI app traffic classification. Finally, compared with conventional messaging
apps when carrying the same content, GenAI chatbots exhibit unique traffic
characteristics, highlighting new stress factors for mobile networks, such as
sustained upstream activity, with direct implications for network monitoring
and management. We publicly release the datasets to support reproducibility and
foster extensions to other use cases.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: This work presents a Network-Optimised Spiking (NOS) delay-aware scheduler
for 6G radio access. The scheme couples a bounded two-state kernel to a
clique-feasible proportional-fair (PF) grant head: the excitability state acts
as a finite-buffer proxy, the recovery state suppresses repeated grants, and
neighbour pressure is injected along the interference graph via delayed spikes.
A small-signal analysis yields a delay-dependent threshold $k_\star(\Delta)$
and a spectral margin $\delta = k_\star(\Delta) - gH\rho(W)$ that compress
topology, controller gain, and delay into a single design parameter. Under
light assumptions on arrivals, we prove geometric ergodicity for $\delta>0$ and
derive sub-Gaussian backlog and delay tail bounds with exponents proportional
to $\delta$. A numerical study, aligned with the analysis and a DU compute
budget, compares NOS with PF and delayed backpressure (BP) across interference
topologies over a $5$--$20$\,ms delay sweep. With a single gain fixed at the
worst spectral radius, NOS sustains higher utilisation and a smaller
99.9th-percentile delay while remaining clique-feasible on integer PRBs.

Abstract: We present a novel protocol that reduces worst-case packet latency in

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Timely delivery of delay-sensitive information over dynamic, heterogeneous
networks is increasingly essential for a range of interactive applications,
such as industrial automation, self-driving vehicles, and augmented reality.
However, most existing network control solutions target only average delay
performance, falling short of providing strict End-to-End (E2E) peak latency
guarantees. This paper addresses the challenge of reliably delivering packets
within application-imposed deadlines by leveraging recent advancements in
Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MA-DRL). After introducing the
Delay-Constrained Maximum-Throughput (DCMT) dynamic network control problem,
and highlighting the limitations of current solutions, we present a novel
MA-DRL network control framework that leverages a centralized routing and
distributed scheduling architecture. The proposed framework leverages critical
networking domain knowledge for the design of effective MA-DRL strategies based
on the Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG) technique, where
centralized routing and distributed scheduling agents dynamically assign paths
and schedule packet transmissions according to packet lifetimes, thereby
maximizing on-time packet delivery. The generality of the proposed framework
allows integrating both data-driven \blue{Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)}
agents and traditional rule-based policies in order to strike the right balance
between performance and learning complexity. Our results confirm the
superiority of the proposed framework with respect to traditional stochastic
optimization-based approaches and provide key insights into the role and
interplay between data-driven DRL agents and new rule-based policies for both
efficient and high-performance control of latency-critical services.

energy efficiency while maintaining the necessary computational resources,
particularly in scenarios where workloads fluctuate significantly over time.
The proposed approach can play a crucial role in heterogeneous systems where
workload characteristics are not uniformly distributed, such as non-pinning
tasks. The deployed THEAS algorithm in this research work ensures a balance
between performance and power consumption, making it suitable for a wide range
of real-time applications. A comparative analysis of the proposed THEAS
algorithm with well-known scheduling techniques such as Completely Fair
Scheduler (CFS), Energy-Aware Scheduling (EAS), Heterogeneous Scheduling
(HeteroSched), and Utility-Based Scheduling is presented in Table III. Each
scheme is compared based on adaptability, core selection criteria, performance
scaling, cache awareness, overhead, and real-time suitability.

Conclusion: 边缘计算在满足SLA方面面临资源扩展挑战，需要进一步研究改进自动扩展算法以解决性能和配置复杂性问题。

Abstract: Edge computing allows for the decentralization of computing resources. This
decentralization is achieved through implementing microservice architectures,
which require low latencies to meet stringent service level agreements (SLA)
such as performance, reliability, and availability metrics. While cloud
computing offers the large data storage and computation resources necessary to
handle peak demands, a hybrid cloud and edge environment is required to ensure
SLA compliance. Several auto-scaling algorithms have been proposed to try to
achieve these compliance challenges, but they suffer from performance issues
and configuration complexity. This chapter provides a brief overview of edge
computing architecture, its uses, benefits, and challenges for resource
scaling. We then introduce Service Level Agreements, and existing research on
devising algorithms used in edge computing environments to meet these
agreements, along with their benefits and drawbacks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 混合专家模型与推测解码结合时，会加剧GPU内存占用和CPU-GPU带宽竞争，现有MoE卸载系统无法解决这一瓶颈。

Method: 提出SP-MoE框架，包括：1）利用草稿模型和目标模型结构对应关系的推测专家预取；2）基于经验配置和分析延迟模型的截止层策略；3）具有异步预取线程和批量I/O的流水线运行时。

Result: 实验表明SP-MoE在多样化数据集、环境和基于MoE的模型上，相比最先进方法实现了1.07-3.5倍的TPOT加速。

Conclusion: SP-MoE是首个SD感知的专家卸载和计算通信流水线框架，有效解决了MoE与推测解码结合时的内存和带宽瓶颈问题。

Abstract: The Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture has been widely adopted in large
language models (LLMs) to reduce computation cost through model sparsity.
Employing speculative decoding (SD) can further accelerate MoE inference by
drafting multiple tokens per step and verifying them in parallel. However,
combining MoE with SD inflates GPU memory and aggravates CPU-GPU bandwidth
contention during multi-token verification. Existing MoE offloading systems are
SD-agnostic and do not address this bottleneck. We present SP-MoE, the first
SD-aware expert-offloading and compute-communication pipelining framework.
SP-MoE introduces: (1) speculative expert prefetching that exploits structural
correspondence between the draft and target models to prefetch likely experts
ahead of verification; (2) a cutoff-layer policy that bounds per-layer prefetch
depth based on empirical profiles and an analytical latency model, guaranteeing
just-in-time availability without overfetch; and (3) a pipelined runtime with
asynchronous prefetch threads and batched I/O to hide loading latency.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that SP-MoE achieves a 1.07-3.5 times TPOT
speedup over state-of-the-art methods across diverse datasets, environments,
and MoE-based models.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模型联邦学习面临数据和系统异构性挑战，现有单模型联邦学习解决方案无法有效应对多模型场景下的额外异构性问题。

Method: 提出FLAMMABLE框架，智能调整客户端批量大小，根据客户端系统能力选择训练多个模型，并开发了首个多模型联邦学习基准平台。

Result: 在多个数据集和模型上的评估显示，FLAMMABLE将时间到精度性能提升1.1-10.0倍，最终模型精度提高1.3-5.4%。

Conclusion: FLAMMABLE有效解决了多模型联邦学习的异构性挑战，为未来可复现的多模型联邦学习研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Multi-Model Federated Learning (MMFL) is an emerging direction in Federated
Learning (FL) where multiple models are trained in parallel, generally on
various datasets. Optimizing the models' accuracies and training times in the
MMFL setting requires adapting to data and system heterogeneity across clients
as in single-model FL; these challenges are amplified in the MMFL setting due
to additional heterogeneity across models. Neither existing solutions nor
na\"ive extensions of single-model FL frameworks efficiently address these
challenges. To bridge this gap, we propose FLAMMABLE, a comprehensive MMFL
training framework. FLAMMABLE optimizes model training by intelligently
adapting client batch sizes while engaging them to train multiple carefully
chosen models, depending on their system capabilities, in each training round.
To evaluate FLAMMABLE, we develop the first benchmark platform for the MMFL
setting, which may enable future reproducible MMFL research. Extensive
evaluations on multiple datasets and models show that FLAMMABLE boosts the MMFL
time-to-accuracy performance by 1.1$\sim$10.0$\times$ while improving the final
model accuracy by 1.3$\sim$5.4\% compared to several known baselines.

Result: 在因果掩码下注意力计算加速1.19x~2.45x，稀疏注意力模式下加速2.15x~3.77x；端到端训练速度在因果掩码下提升0.94x~1.16x，稀疏掩码下提升1.00x~1.46x。

Conclusion: DCP框架通过动态适应序列特征，有效解决了现有上下文并行方法的局限性，显著提升了长上下文训练的效率。

Abstract: Context parallelism has emerged as a key technique to support long-context
training, a growing trend in generative AI for modern large models. However,
existing context parallel methods rely on static parallelization configurations
that overlook the dynamic nature of training data, specifically, the
variability in sequence lengths and token relationships (i.e., attention
patterns) across samples. As a result, these methods often suffer from
unnecessary communication overhead and imbalanced computation. In this paper,
we present DCP, a dynamic context parallel training framework that introduces
fine-grained blockwise partitioning of both data and computation. By enabling
flexible mapping of data and computation blocks to devices, DCP can adapt to
varying sequence characteristics, effectively reducing communication and
improving memory and computation balance. Micro-benchmarks demonstrate that DCP
accelerates attention by 1.19x~2.45x under causal masks and 2.15x~3.77x under
sparse attention patterns. Additionally, we observe up to 0.94x~1.16x
end-to-end training speed-up for causal masks, and 1.00x~1.46x for sparse
masks.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Research in compute resource management for cloud-native applications is
dominated by the problem of setting optimal CPU limits -- a fundamental OS
mechanism that strictly restricts a container's CPU usage to its specified
CPU-limits . Rightsizing and autoscaling works have innovated on
allocation/scaling policies assuming the ubiquity and necessity of CPU-limits .
We question this. Practical experiences of cloud users indicate that CPU-limits
harms application performance and costs more than it helps. These observations
are in contradiction to the conventional wisdom presented in both academic
research and industry best practices. We argue that this indiscriminate
adoption of CPU-limits is driven by erroneous beliefs that CPU-limits is
essential for operational and safety purposes. We provide empirical evidence
making a case for eschewing CPU-limits completely from latency-sensitive
applications. This prompts a fundamental rethinking of auto-scaling and billing
paradigms and opens new research avenues. Finally, we highlight specific
scenarios where CPU-limits can be beneficial if used in a well-reasoned way
(e.g. background jobs).

Abstract: We present the first spin-free, kernel-lock-free mutex that cooperates with
user-mode schedulers and is formally proven FIFO-fair and linearizable using
CSP/FDR. Our fairness oracle and stability-based proof method are reusable
across coroutine runtime designs. We designed the claim/release protocol for a
process-oriented language -- ProcessJ -- to manage the race for claiming shared
inter-process communication channels. Internally, we use a lock-free queue to
park waiting processes for gaining access to a shared object, such as exclusive
access to a shared channel to read from or write to. The queue ensures control
and fairness for processes wishing to access a shared resource, as the protocol
handles claim requests in the order they are inserted into the queue. We
produce CSP models of our protocol and a mutex specification, demonstrating
with FDR that our protocol behaves as a locking mutex.

increase Satisfaction and Performance of this framework. At first we analyze
previous frameworks related to integrated systems, then represent new proposed
framework in order to improving previous framework, and we discuss its
different phases. Finally we compare the results of simulation of the new
framework with previous ones. In FIDRS framework, the technique of
heterogeneous distributed data base is used to improve Performance and speed in
responding to users and in this way we can improve dependability and
reliability of framework simultaneously. In extraction phase of the new
framework we have used RMSD algorithm that decreases responding time in big

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: As microservice-based systems scale across the cloud-edge continuum,
traditional centralized scheduling mechanisms increasingly struggle with
latency, coordination overhead, and fault tolerance. This paper presents a new
architectural direction: leveraging service mesh sidecar proxies as
decentralized, in-situ schedulers to enable scalable, low-latency coordination
in large-scale, cloud-native environments. We propose embedding lightweight,
autonomous scheduling logic into each sidecar, allowing scheduling decisions to
be made locally without centralized control. This approach leverages the
growing maturity of service mesh infrastructures, which support programmable
distributed traffic management. We describe the design of such an architecture
and present initial results demonstrating its scalability potential in terms of
response time and latency under varying request rates. Rather than delivering a
finalized scheduling algorithm, this paper presents a system-level
architectural direction and preliminary evidence to support its scalability
potential.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large language models (LLM) are advanced AI systems trained on extensive
textual data, leveraging deep learning techniques to understand and generate
human-like language. Today's LLMs with billions of parameters are so huge that
hardly any single computing node can train, fine-tune, or infer from them.
Therefore, several distributed computing techniques are being introduced in the
literature to properly utilize LLMs. We have explored the application of
distributed computing techniques in LLMs from two angles.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item We study the techniques that democratize the LLM, that is, how large
models can be run on consumer-grade computers. Here, we also implement a novel
metaheuristics-based modification to an existing system.
  \item We perform a comparative study on three state-of-the-art LLM serving
techniques. \end{itemize}

Abstract: We address the problem of computing a Minimum Weighted Vertex Cover (MWVC) in
a decentralized network. MWVC, a classical NP-hard problem, is foundational in
applications such as network monitoring and resource placement. We propose a
fully decentralized protocol where each node makes decisions using only local
knowledge and communicates with its neighbors. The method is adaptive,
communication-efficient, and avoids centralized coordination. We evaluate the
protocol on real-world and synthetic graphs, comparing it to both centralized
and decentralized baselines. Our results demonstrate competitive solution
quality with reduced communication overhead, highlighting the feasibility of
MWVC computation in decentralized environments.

Motivation: 研究大语言模型如何在其表示空间中"思考"，探索LLM是否真正内化了逻辑推理能力，而不仅仅是依赖表面形式的语义模式。

Method: 提出几何框架将LLM推理建模为表示空间中的流动轨迹，使用相同自然演绎命题但不同语义载体的方法分离逻辑和语义，通过位置、速度和曲率等几何量分析推理过程。

Result: 理论建立了：(1) LLM推理对应表示空间中的平滑流动；(2) 逻辑语句作为这些流动速度的局部控制器。通过受控实验可视化和量化推理流动，验证了理论框架。

Conclusion: 该工作为研究推理现象提供了概念基础和实践工具，为LLM行为的可解释性和形式分析提供了新的视角。

Abstract: We study how large language models (LLMs) ``think'' through their
representation space. We propose a novel geometric framework that models an
LLM's reasoning as flows -- embedding trajectories evolving where logic goes.
We disentangle logical structure from semantics by employing the same natural
deduction propositions with varied semantic carriers, allowing us to test
whether LLMs internalize logic beyond surface form. This perspective connects
reasoning with geometric quantities such as position, velocity, and curvature,
enabling formal analysis in representation and concept spaces. Our theory
establishes: (1) LLM reasoning corresponds to smooth flows in representation
space, and (2) logical statements act as local controllers of these flows'
velocities. Using learned representation proxies, we design controlled
experiments to visualize and quantify reasoning flows, providing empirical
validation of our theoretical framework. Our work serves as both a conceptual
foundation and practical tools for studying reasoning phenomenon, offering a
new lens for interpretability and formal analysis of LLMs' behavior.

Motivation: 现有基准测试大多假设完全自动化，未能反映真实世界中人机协作的本质，需要更严谨的方法来评估人类与智能体的交互效果。

Method: 提出PULSE评估框架，包含用户反馈收集、训练ML模型预测用户满意度、结合人工评分与模型生成伪标签计算结果。在OpenHands开源软件智能体平台上部署该框架，收集超过15k用户的真实使用数据。

Result: 通过案例研究分析了三个智能体设计决策（LLM主干选择、规划策略、记忆机制）对开发者满意度的影响，显示框架可将置信区间减少40%。发现真实使用结果与基准测试性能存在显著差异（如claude-sonnet-4与gpt-5结果呈负相关）。

Conclusion: 研究结果为LLM智能体的人类评估提供了指导，指出了基准驱动评估的局限性，并识别了改进智能体设计的机会。

Abstract: LLM-powered agents are both a promising new technology and a source of
complexity, where choices about models, tools, and prompting can affect their
usefulness. While numerous benchmarks measure agent accuracy across domains,
they mostly assume full automation, failing to represent the collaborative
nature of real-world use cases. In this paper, we make two major steps towards
the rigorous assessment of human-agent interactions. First, we propose PULSE, a
framework for more efficient human-centric evaluation of agent designs, which
comprises collecting user feedback, training an ML model to predict user
satisfaction, and computing results by combining human satisfaction ratings
with model-generated pseudo-labels. Second, we deploy the framework on a
large-scale web platform built around the open-source software agent OpenHands,
collecting in-the-wild usage data across over 15k users. We conduct case
studies around how three agent design decisions -- choice of LLM backbone,
planning strategy, and memory mechanisms -- impact developer satisfaction
rates, yielding practical insights for software agent design. We also show how
our framework can lead to more robust conclusions about agent design, reducing
confidence intervals by 40\% compared to a standard A/B test. Finally, we find
substantial discrepancies between in-the-wild results and benchmark performance
(e.g., the anti-correlation between results comparing claude-sonnet-4 and
gpt-5), underscoring the limitations of benchmark-driven evaluation. Our
findings provide guidance for evaluations of LLM agents with humans and
identify opportunities for better agent designs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的地球观测驱动的空间表示主要编码物理和光谱模式，但缺乏捕捉城市功能和社会经济维度的人类活动信息。

Method: 提出AETHER框架，通过多模态对齐将AlphaEarth嵌入与POI文本表示对齐，在预训练的AE基础上进行轻量级多模态对齐，丰富物理基础特征与人类中心语义。

Result: 在伦敦大区，AETHER相比AE基线在土地利用分类F1得分上相对提升7.2%，在社会经济映射的Kullback-Leibler散度上相对减少23.6%。

Conclusion: AETHER通过耦合地球观测与人类中心语义，推进了地理空间基础模型向整合物理形态和功能意义的通用城市表示发展。

Abstract: General-purpose spatial representations are essential for building
transferable geospatial foundation models (GFMs). Among them, the AlphaEarth
Foundation (AE) represents a major step toward a global, unified representation
of the Earth's surface, learning 10-meter embeddings from multi-source Earth
Observation (EO) data that capture rich physical and environmental patterns
across diverse landscapes. However, such EO-driven representations remain
limited in capturing the functional and socioeconomic dimensions of cities, as
they primarily encode physical and spectral patterns rather than human
activities or spatial functions. We propose AETHER (AlphaEarth-POI Enriched
Representation Learning), a lightweight framework that adapts AlphaEarth to
human-centered urban analysis through multimodal alignment guided by Points of
Interest (POIs). AETHER aligns AE embeddings with textual representations of
POIs, enriching physically grounded EO features with semantic cues about urban
functions and socioeconomic contexts. In Greater London, AETHER achieves
consistent gains over the AE baseline, with a 7.2% relative improvement in
land-use classification F1 and a 23.6% relative reduction in Kullback-Leibler
divergence for socioeconomic mapping. Built upon pretrained AE, AETHER
leverages a lightweight multimodal alignment to enrich it with human-centered
semantics while remaining computationally efficient and scalable for urban
applications. By coupling EO with human-centered semantics, it advances
geospatial foundation models toward general-purpose urban representations that
integrate both physical form and functional meaning.

Motivation: 随着个性化AI系统越来越多地整合长期用户记忆，理解这种记忆如何塑造情感推理变得至关重要。需要研究用户记忆对大型语言模型情感智能的影响。

Method: 通过评估15个大型语言模型在人类验证的情感智能测试上的表现，分析相同情境下不同用户档案对情感解释的影响。

Result: 发现相同情境与不同用户档案配对会产生系统性不同的情感解释；多个高性能LLM中出现系统性偏差，优势群体获得更准确的情感解读；在情感理解和支持性建议任务中，LLM在不同人口统计因素上表现出显著差异。

Conclusion: 记忆增强AI面临关键挑战：为个性化设计的系统可能无意中强化社会不平等，个性化机制可能将社会等级嵌入模型的情感推理中。

Abstract: When an AI assistant remembers that Sarah is a single mother working two
jobs, does it interpret her stress differently than if she were a wealthy
executive? As personalized AI systems increasingly incorporate long-term user
memory, understanding how this memory shapes emotional reasoning is critical.
We investigate how user memory affects emotional intelligence in large language
models (LLMs) by evaluating 15 models on human validated emotional intelligence
tests. We find that identical scenarios paired with different user profiles
produce systematically divergent emotional interpretations. Across validated
user independent emotional scenarios and diverse user profiles, systematic
biases emerged in several high-performing LLMs where advantaged profiles
received more accurate emotional interpretations. Moreover, LLMs demonstrate
significant disparities across demographic factors in emotion understanding and
supportive recommendations tasks, indicating that personalization mechanisms
can embed social hierarchies into models emotional reasoning. These results
highlight a key challenge for memory enhanced AI: systems designed for
personalization may inadvertently reinforce social inequalities.

Motivation: 大型语言模型存在关键推理缺陷，包括幻觉倾向和逻辑谬误分类准确性差，这源于其默认的快速直觉式系统1处理，而可靠推理需要深思熟虑的系统2方法。由于完整的系统2训练成本高昂，需要探索低成本干预方案。

Method: 引入新颖的分步指令数据集，将谬误分类分解为一系列原子程序步骤（简单二元问题），并增加最终验证步骤，让模型咨询相关谬误的关系知识图谱。

Result: 这种基于规则的程序化干预显著提高了LLM的逻辑谬误分类能力。

Conclusion: 该方法为神经符号架构解决LLM推理缺陷提供了一条实用路径，同时增强了LLM决策过程的透明度。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from critical reasoning gaps, including a
tendency to hallucinate and poor accuracy in classifying logical fallacies.
This limitation stems from their default System 1 processing, which is fast and
intuitive, whereas reliable reasoning requires the deliberate, effortful System
2 approach (Kahneman, 2011; Li et al., 2025). Since full System 2 training is
often prohibitively expensive, we explore a low-cost, instruction-based
intervention to bridge this gap. Our methodology introduces a novel stepwise
instruction dataset that decomposes fallacy classification into a series of
atomic procedural steps (simple binary questions). We further augment this with
a final verification step where models consult a relational knowledge graph of
related fallacies. This procedural, rule-based intervention yields a
significant improvement in LLM logical fallacy classification. Crucially, the
approach also provides enhanced transparency into the LLMs' decision-making,
highlighting a practical pathway for Neuro-symbolic architectures to address
LLM reasoning deficits.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在敏感日常场景中的部署增加，需要理解其在复杂道德推理中的价值取向。现有研究多基于单轮提示，但多轮对话中的价值形成过程尚不明确。

Method: 使用LLM辩论方法，让GPT-4.1、Claude 3.7 Sonnet和Gemini 2.0 Flash三个模型对Reddit"Am I the Asshole"社区的1000个日常困境进行集体归责判断，采用同步（并行响应）和轮询（顺序响应）两种格式测试顺序效应和判决修订。

Result: GPT表现出强惯性（修订率0.6-3.1%），Claude和Gemini更灵活（修订率28-41%）。GPT强调个人自主权和直接沟通，Claude和Gemini优先考虑共情对话。辩论格式对模型行为有强烈影响，GPT和Gemini表现出高度从众性。

Conclusion: 多轮互动中的道德推理受到辩论格式和模型特定行为的共同影响，表明社会技术对齐不仅取决于系统输出，还取决于对话结构的设计。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in sensitive
everyday contexts - offering personal advice, mental health support, and moral
guidance - understanding their elicited values in navigating complex moral
reasoning is essential. Most evaluations study this sociotechnical alignment
through single-turn prompts, but it is unclear if these findings extend to
multi-turn settings where values emerge through dialogue, revision, and
consensus. We address this gap using LLM debate to examine deliberative
dynamics and value alignment in multi-turn settings by prompting subsets of
three models (GPT-4.1, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, and Gemini 2.0 Flash) to collectively
assign blame in 1,000 everyday dilemmas from Reddit's "Am I the Asshole"
community. We use both synchronous (parallel responses) and round-robin
(sequential responses) formats to test order effects and verdict revision. Our
findings show striking behavioral differences. In the synchronous setting, GPT
showed strong inertia (0.6-3.1% revision rates) while Claude and Gemini were
far more flexible (28-41%). Value patterns also diverged: GPT emphasized
personal autonomy and direct communication, while Claude and Gemini prioritized
empathetic dialogue. Certain values proved especially effective at driving
verdict changes. We further find that deliberation format had a strong impact
on model behavior: GPT and Gemini stood out as highly conforming relative to
Claude, with their verdict behavior strongly shaped by order effects. These
results show how deliberation format and model-specific behaviors shape moral
reasoning in multi-turn interactions, underscoring that sociotechnical
alignment depends on how systems structure dialogue as much as on their
outputs.

Motivation: 现有研究主要针对简化RAG架构的白盒攻击，但实际攻击场景中攻击者缺乏RAG系统内部知识，且RAG系统包含多个复杂组件，需要研究更现实的攻击场景。

Method: 提出RIPRAG攻击框架，将目标RAG系统视为黑盒，仅利用攻击是否成功的信息，使用强化学习优化投毒文档生成模型，确保生成的投毒文档符合目标RAG系统的偏好。

Conclusion: 该方法揭示了当前防御方法的普遍缺陷，为LLM安全研究提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems based on Large Language Models
(LLMs) have become a core technology for tasks such as question-answering (QA)
and content generation. However, by injecting poisoned documents into the
database of RAG systems, attackers can manipulate LLMs to generate text that
aligns with their intended preferences. Existing research has primarily focused
on white-box attacks against simplified RAG architectures. In this paper, we
investigate a more complex and realistic scenario: the attacker lacks knowledge
of the RAG system's internal composition and implementation details, and the
RAG system comprises components beyond a mere retriever. Specifically, we
propose the RIPRAG attack framework, an end-to-end attack pipeline that treats
the target RAG system as a black box, where the only information accessible to
the attacker is whether the poisoning succeeds. Our method leverages
Reinforcement Learning (RL) to optimize the generation model for poisoned
documents, ensuring that the generated poisoned document aligns with the target
RAG system's preferences. Experimental results demonstrate that this method can
effectively execute poisoning attacks against most complex RAG systems,
achieving an attack success rate (ASR) improvement of up to 0.72 compared to
baseline methods. This highlights prevalent deficiencies in current defensive
methods and provides critical insights for LLM security research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM工作流优化方法将丰富的多步执行轨迹简化为简单的成功/失败信号，导致信息坍塌，无法建模工作流的失败分布结构。

Method: 提出CE-Graph框架：通过反例池近似失败分布，识别密集区域作为重复失败模式，通过提议-验证机制应用有针对性的图编辑来贪婪地减少失败质量。

Result: 在数学、代码和问答基准测试中，CE-Graph以显著更低的成本实现了比强基线更高的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 系统的可靠性不是来自避免失败，而是来自系统地学习和重塑其失败分布的几何结构。

Abstract: Optimizing LLM-based workflows is typically formulated as a global search,
where candidate workflows are evaluated based on a scalar metric. This
paradigm, however, suffers from a critical flaw: information collapse. By
reducing rich, multi-step execution traces to simple success/failure signals,
existing methods are rendered blind to the underlying structure of failures,
fundamentally preventing them from modeling the workflow's failure
distribution. We reconceptualize this challenge as a distributional problem. We
propose a new paradigm where the optimization goal is not to maximize a scalar
score, but to directly minimize a workflow's Expected Failure Mass, i.e., the
integral of its failure probability density function defined over a
high-dimensional Failure Signature Space (FSS). This distributional lens allows
us to move from inefficient, zero-order optimization to a principled,
gradient-like descent on the failure landscape itself. We introduce CE-Graph, a
framework that operationalizes this paradigm through a novel, failure-driven
refinement process. CE-Graph approximates the failure distribution from a pool
of counterexamples, identifies its densest regions as recurring failure modes,
and applies targeted, operator-constrained graph edits via a Propose-and-Verify
mechanism to greedily reduce the failure mass. On math, code, and QA
benchmarks, our CE-Graph achieves higher robustness at a significantly lower
cost than strong baselines. This suggests that a system's reliability emerges
not from avoiding failures, but from systematically learning and reshaping the
geometric structure of its failure distributions.

Abstract: The steady growth of artificial intelligence (AI) has accelerated in the
recent years, facilitated by the development of sophisticated models such as
large language models and foundation models. Ensuring robust and reliable power
infrastructures is fundamental to take advantage of the full potential of AI.
However, AI data centres are extremely hungry for power, putting the problem of
their power management in the spotlight, especially with respect to their
impact on environment and sustainable development. In this work, we investigate
the capacity and limits of solutions based on an innovative approach for the
power management of AI data centres, i.e., making part of the input power as
dynamic as the power used for data-computing functions. The performance of
passive and active devices are quantified and compared in terms of
computational gain, energy efficiency, reduction of capital expenditure, and
management costs by analysing power trends from multiple data platforms
worldwide. This strategy, which identifies a paradigm shift in the AI data

sustainability of AI hyperscalers, enhancing their footprint on environmental,

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have shown remarkable reasoning abilities.
However, existing multi-agent frameworks often rely on fixed roles or
centralized control, limiting scalability and adaptability in long-horizon
reasoning. We introduce SwarmSys, a closed-loop framework for distributed
multi-agent reasoning inspired by swarm intelligence. Coordination in SwarmSys
emerges through iterative interactions among three specialized roles,
Explorers, Workers, and Validators, that continuously cycle through
exploration, exploitation, and validation. To enable scalable and adaptive
collaboration, we integrate adaptive agent and event profiles, embedding-based
probabilistic matching, and a pheromone-inspired reinforcement mechanism,
supporting dynamic task allocation and self-organizing convergence without
global supervision. Across symbolic reasoning, research synthesis, and
scientific programming tasks, SwarmSys consistently outperforms baselines,
improving both accuracy and reasoning stability. These findings highlight
swarm-inspired coordination as a promising paradigm for scalable, robust, and
adaptive multi-agent reasoning, suggesting that coordination scaling may rival
model scaling in advancing LLM intelligence.

Abstract: We introduce SyncLipMAE, a self-supervised pretraining framework for
talking-face video that learns synchronization-aware and transferable facial
dynamics from unlabeled audio-visual streams. Our approach couples masked
visual modeling with cross-modal contrastive alignment and employs three
per-frame prompt tokens that explicitly encode the essential factors of a
talking-face frame - identity, vocal motion (speech-synchronized facial
dynamics), and ambient motion (audio-agnostic movements such as blinks and head
pose). The contrastive objective uses time-aligned vocal-motion and audio
tokens as positives and misaligned pairs as negatives, driving both modalities
into a shared embedding space and yielding token-level audio-visual stream
synchronization. After pretraining, the aligned audio tokens together with the
visual prompt tokens (identity, vocal motion, ambient motion) form a unified
interface for four disparate downstream settings: (i) audio-visual stream
synchronization; (ii) facial emotion and head/face action recognition; (iii)
visual speech recognition; and (iv) visual dubbing, for which we enable
indistinguishable audio- or video-driven control within a single model. Across
four task families that require distinct capabilities, SyncLipMAE achieves
state-of-the-art results, underscoring the effectiveness of
synchronization-aware, factorized self-supervised pretraining.

Abstract: Effective incident management in large-scale IT systems relies on
troubleshooting guides (TSGs), but their manual execution is slow and
error-prone. While recent advances in LLMs offer promise for automating
incident management tasks, existing LLM-based solutions lack specialized
support for several key challenges, including managing TSG quality issues,
interpreting complex control flow, handling data-intensive queries, and
exploiting execution parallelism. We first conducted an empirical study on 92
real-world TSGs, and, guided by our findings, we present StepFly, a novel
end-to-end agentic framework for troubleshooting guide automation. Our approach
features a three-stage workflow: the first stage provides a comprehensive guide
together with a tool, TSG Mentor, to assist SREs in improving TSG quality; the
second stage performs offline preprocessing using LLMs to extract structured
execution DAGs from unstructured TSGs and to create dedicated Query Preparation
Plugins (QPPs); and the third stage executes online using a DAG-guided
scheduler-executor framework with a memory system to guarantee correct workflow
and support parallel execution of independent steps. Our empirical evaluation
on a collection of real-world TSGs and incidents demonstrates that StepFly
achieves a ~94% success rate on GPT-4.1, outperforming baselines with less time
and token consumption. Furthermore, it achieves a remarkable execution time
reduction of 32.9% to 70.4% for parallelizable TSGs.

Abstract: Multimodal abductive reasoning--the generation and selection of explanatory
hypotheses from partial observations--is a cornerstone of intelligence. Current
evaluations of this ability in vision-language models (VLMs) are largely
confined to static, single-agent tasks. Inspired by Dixit, we introduce
DixitWorld, a comprehensive evaluation suite designed to deconstruct this
challenge. DIXITWORLD features two core components: DixitArena, a dynamic,
multi-agent environment that evaluates both hypothesis generation (a
"storyteller" crafting cryptic clues) and hypothesis selection ("listeners"
choosing the target image from decoys) under imperfect information; and
DixitBench, a static QA benchmark that isolates the listener's task for
efficient, controlled evaluation. Results from DixitArena reveal distinct,
role-dependent behaviors: smaller open-source models often excel as creative
storytellers, producing imaginative yet less discriminative clues, whereas
larger proprietary models demonstrate superior overall performance,
particularly as listeners. Performance on DixitBench strongly correlates with
listener results in DixitArena, validating it as a reliable proxy for
hypothesis selection. Our findings reveal a key trade-off between generative
creativity and discriminative understanding in multimodal abductive reasoning,
a central challenge for developing more balanced and capable vision-language
agents.

it well-suited for real-world applications such as story illustration and

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Concise reasoning in large language models seeks to generate only essential
intermediate steps needed to arrive at a final answer, thereby alleviating
issues of overthinking. Most proposed approaches hinge on carefully
hand-crafted heuristics, struggling to balance concision with performance,
often failing to adapt across domains and model scales. In this work, we
address these challenges by introducing a principled and pragmatic strategy,
performance-aware length updating (PALU). As a principled algorithm, PALU
formulates concise reasoning as a constrained optimization problem, minimizing
response length subject to a performance constraint, and then applies
Lagrangian optimization to convert it into a tractable unconstrained problem.
As a pragmatic solution, PALU streamlines complicated update rules through
three approximations: (i) estimating performance with off-policy rollouts, (ii)
truncating the Lagrange multiplier to two extremes, and (iii) replacing
gradient-based updates with quantile-driven length adjustments. PALU reduces
output length by 65% while improving accuracy by 15% when applied to
DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, averaged over five benchmarks, outperforming a
range of alternative methods. Furthermore, PALU is demonstrated to adapt across
both domain (logic, STEM and math) and model scale (1.5B, 7B, 14B) entrenching
the algorithm as a practical and effective concise reasoning approach.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in risk-sensitive
applications such as real-world open-ended question answering (QA), ensuring
the trustworthiness of their outputs has become critical. Existing selective
conformal prediction (SCP) methods provide statistical guarantees by
constructing prediction sets with a constrained miscoverage rate for correct
answers. However, prior works unrealistically assume that admissible answers
for all instances can be obtained via finite sampling, even for open-ended QA
scenarios that lack a fixed and finite solution space. To address this, we
introduce a two-stage risk control framework comprising abstention-aware
sampling and conformalized filtering (SAFER). Firstly, on a held-out
calibration set, SAFER calibrates a sampling budget within the maximum sampling
cap, using the Clopper-Pearson exact method at a user-desired risk level (i.e.,
the maximum allowable miscoverage rate of the sampling sets). If the risk level
cannot be satisfied within the cap, we abstain; otherwise, the calibrated
sampling budget becomes the minimum requirements at test time. Then, we employ
calibration instances where correct answers are attainable under the calibrated
budget and apply the conformal risk control method to determine a statistically
valid uncertainty threshold, which filters unreliable distractors from the
candidate set for each test data point. In this stage, SAFER introduces an
additional risk level to guide the calculation of the threshold, thereby
controlling the risk of correct answers being excluded. Furthermore, we show
that SAFER is compatible with various task-specific admission criteria and
calibration-test split ratios, highlighting its robustness and high data
efficiency.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents show great promise for complex, multi-turn
tool-use tasks, but their development is often hampered by the extreme scarcity
of high-quality training data. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on synthetic data
leads to overfitting, whereas standard reinforcement learning (RL) struggles
with a critical cold-start problem and training instability. To address these
challenges, we introduce $\textbf{Environment Tuning}$, a novel training
paradigm that enables agents to learn complex behaviors directly from problem
instances without relying on pre-collected expert trajectories.
$\textbf{Environment Tuning}$ orchestrates this learning process through a
structured curriculum, actionable environment augmentation that provides
corrective feedback, and fine-grained progress rewards to ensure stable and
efficient exploration. Using only 400 problem instances from Berkeley
Function-Calling Leaderboard (BFCL) benchmark, our method not only achieves
competitive in-distribution performance against strong baselines but also
demonstrates superior out-of-distribution generalization, overcoming the
performance collapse common to SFT-based approaches. Our work presents a
paradigm shift from supervised fine-tuning on static trajectories to dynamic,
environment-based exploration, paving the way for training more robust and
data-efficient agents.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Reliable behavior control is central to deploying large language models
(LLMs) on the web. Activation steering offers a tuning-free route to align
attributes (e.g., truthfulness) that ensure trustworthy generation. Prevailing
approaches rely on coarse heuristics and lack a principled account of where to
steer and how strongly to intervene. To this end, we propose Position-wise
Injection with eXact Estimated Levels (PIXEL), a position-wise activation
steering framework that, in contrast to prior work, learns a property-aligned
subspace from dual views (tail-averaged and end-token) and selects intervention
strength via a constrained geometric objective with a closed-form solution,
thereby adapting to token-level sensitivity without global hyperparameter
tuning. PIXEL further performs sample-level orthogonal residual calibration to
refine the global attribute direction and employs a lightweight
position-scanning routine to identify receptive injection sites. We
additionally provide representation-level guarantees for the
minimal-intervention rule, supporting reliable alignment. Across diverse models
and evaluation paradigms, PIXEL consistently improves attribute alignment while
preserving model general capabilities, offering a practical and principled
method for LLMs' controllable generation. Our code is available at

Abstract: Although Long Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved superior performance on
various reasoning scenarios, they often suffer from increased computational
costs and inference latency caused by overthinking. To address these
limitations, we propose Adaptive Dual Reasoner, which supports two reasoning
modes: fast thinking and slow thinking. ADR dynamically alternates between
these modes based on the contextual complexity during reasoning. ADR is trained
in two stages: (1) A cold-start stage using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to
equip the model with the ability to integrate both fast and slow reasoning
modes, in which we construct a hybrid reasoning dataset through a dedicated
pipeline to provide large-scale supervision. (2) A reinforcement learning stage
for optimizing reasoning effort, where we introduce Entropy-guided Hybrid
Policy Optimization EHPO, an RL training framework employing an entropy-guided
dynamic rollout strategy for branching at high-entropy units and a
difficulty-aware penalty to balance fast and slow reasoning. Across challenging
mathematical reasoning benchmarks, ADR achieves an effective balance between
reasoning performance and efficiency among state-of-the-art approaches.
Specifically, ADR yields a performance gain of up to 6.1%, while reducing the
reasoning output length by 49.5% to 59.3%.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become foundational tools in natural
language processing, powering a wide range of applications and research. Many
studies have shown that LLMs share significant similarities with the human
brain. Recent neuroscience research has found that a small subset of biological
neurons in the human brain are crucial for core cognitive functions, which
raises a fundamental question: do LLMs also contain a small subset of critical
neurons? In this paper, we investigate this question by proposing a
Perturbation-based Causal Identification of Critical Neurons method to
systematically locate such critical neurons in LLMs. Our findings reveal three
key insights: (1) LLMs contain ultra-sparse critical neuron sets. Disrupting
these critical neurons can cause a 72B-parameter model with over 1.1 billion
neurons to completely collapse, with perplexity increasing by up to 20 orders
of magnitude; (2) These critical neurons are not uniformly distributed, but
tend to concentrate in the outer layers, particularly within the MLP down\_proj
components; (3) Performance degradation exhibits sharp phase transitions,
rather than a gradual decline, when these critical neurons are disrupted.
Through comprehensive experiments across diverse model architectures and
scales, we provide deeper analysis of these phenomena and their implications
for LLM robustness and interpretability. These findings can offer guidance for
developing more robust model architectures and improving deployment security in
safety-critical applications.

Abstract: Multimodal large reasoning models (MLRMs) are rapidly advancing
vision-language reasoning and are emerging as a foundation for cross-modal
intelligence. Hallucination remains a persistent failure mode, manifesting
itself as erroneous reasoning chains and misinterpretation of visual content.
In this study, we observe that attention heads exhibit a staged division:
shallow heads predominantly serve perception, while deeper heads shift toward
symbolic reasoning, revealing two major causes of hallucination, namely
perceptual bias and reasoning drift. To address these issues, we propose a
lightweight and interpretable two-step plugin, Functional Head Identification
and Class-conditioned Rescaling, which locates perception- and
reasoning-oriented heads and regulates their contributions without retraining.
Evaluations on three real-world MLRMs (Kimi-VL, Ocean-R1, R1-Onevision), six
benchmarks across three domains, and four baselines show that our plugin
achieves an average improvement of 5% and up to 15%, with only <1% additional
computation and 9% of baseline latency. Our approach is completely
model-agnostic and significantly enhances both the reliability and
interpretability of the off-the-shelf MLRMs, thereby enabling their safe
deployment in high-stakes applications. Our code is available at

Abstract: While ethical arguments for fairness in healthcare AI are well-established,
the economic and strategic value of inclusive design remains underexplored.
This perspective introduces the ``inclusive innovation dividend'' -- the
counterintuitive principle that solutions engineered for diverse, constrained
use cases generate superior economic returns in broader markets. Drawing from
assistive technologies that evolved into billion-dollar mainstream industries,
we demonstrate how inclusive healthcare AI development creates business value
beyond compliance requirements. We identify four mechanisms through which
inclusive innovation drives returns: (1) market expansion via geographic
scalability and trust acceleration; (2) risk mitigation through reduced
remediation costs and litigation exposure; (3) performance dividends from
superior generalization and reduced technical debt, and (4) competitive
advantages in talent acquisition and clinical adoption. We present the
Healthcare AI Inclusive Innovation Framework (HAIIF), a practical scoring
system that enables organizations to evaluate AI investments based on their
potential to capture these benefits. HAIIF provides structured guidance for
resource allocation, transforming fairness and inclusivity from regulatory
checkboxes into sources of strategic differentiation. Our findings suggest that
organizations investing incrementally in inclusive design can achieve expanded
market reach and sustained competitive advantages, while those treating these
considerations as overhead face compounding disadvantages as network effects
and data advantages accrue to early movers.

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification for LLMs is a key research direction towards
addressing hallucination and other issues that limit their reliable deployment.
In this work, we show that reasoning trace length is a simple and useful
confidence estimator in large reasoning models. Through comprehensive
experiments across multiple models, datasets, and prompts, we show that trace
length performs in comparable but complementary ways to other zero-shot
confidence estimators such as verbalized confidence. Our work reveals that
reasoning post-training fundamentally alters the relationship between trace
length and accuracy, going beyond prior work that had shown that post-training
causes traces to grow longer in general (e.g., "overthinking"). We investigate
the mechanisms behind trace length's performance as a confidence signal,
observing that the effect remains even after adjusting for confounders such as
problem difficulty and GRPO-induced length bias. We identify high-entropy or
"forking" tokens as playing a key role in the mechanism. Our findings
demonstrate that reasoning post-training enhances uncertainty quantification
beyond verbal expressions, and establish trace length as a practical confidence
measure for large reasoning models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer a generalizable approach for modeling

health records (EHR) data in temporal reasoning. To address these challenges,
we introduce Traj-CoA, a multi-agent system involving chain-of-agents for
patient trajectory modeling. Traj-CoA employs a chain of worker agents to
process EHR data in manageable chunks sequentially, distilling critical events
into a shared long-term memory module, EHRMem, to reduce noise and preserve a
comprehensive timeline. A final manager agent synthesizes the worker agents'
summary and the extracted timeline in EHRMem to make predictions. In a
zero-shot one-year lung cancer risk prediction task based on five-year EHR
data, Traj-CoA outperforms baselines of four categories. Analysis reveals that
Traj-CoA exhibits clinically aligned temporal reasoning, establishing it as a
promisingly robust and generalizable approach for modeling complex patient
trajectories.

Abstract: Autonomous agents utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated

Abstract: Reasoning models improve their problem-solving ability through inference-time
scaling, allocating more compute via longer token budgets. Identifying which
reasoning traces are likely to succeed remains a key opportunity: reliably
predicting productive paths can substantially reduce wasted computation and
improve overall efficiency. We introduce Latent-Trajectory signals that
characterize the temporal evolution of a model's internal representations
during the generation of intermediate reasoning tokens. By measuring the
overall change in latent representations between the start and end of
reasoning, the change accumulated across intermediate steps, and the extent to
which these changes advance toward the final state, we show that these signals
predict solution accuracy more reliably than both cross-layer metrics and
output-based confidence measures. When used to guide answer selection across
multiple sampled generations, Latent-Trajectory signals make test-time scaling
more effective and efficient than majority voting, reducing token usage by up
to 70% while preserving and even improving accuracy by 2.6% on average.
Moreover, these predictive signals often emerge early in the reasoning trace,
enabling early selection and allocation of compute to the most promising
candidates. Our findings contribute not only practical strategies for
inference-time efficiency, but also a deeper interpretability perspective on
how reasoning processes are represented and differentiated in latent space.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) excel at many domain-specific tasks, their
ability to deeply comprehend and reason about full-length academic papers
remains underexplored. Existing benchmarks often fall short of capturing such
depth, either due to surface-level question design or unreliable evaluation
metrics. To address this gap, we introduce ELAIPBench, a benchmark curated by
domain experts to evaluate LLMs' comprehension of artificial intelligence (AI)
research papers. Developed through an incentive-driven, adversarial annotation
process, ELAIPBench features 403 multiple-choice questions from 137 papers. It
spans three difficulty levels and emphasizes non-trivial reasoning rather than
shallow retrieval. Our experiments show that the best-performing LLM achieves
an accuracy of only 39.95%, far below human performance. Moreover, we observe
that frontier LLMs equipped with a thinking mode or a retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) system fail to improve final results-even harming accuracy due
to overthinking or noisy retrieval. These findings underscore the significant
gap between current LLM capabilities and genuine comprehension of academic
papers.

Abstract: Existing studies have introduced method-based reasoning and scope extension
as approaches to enhance Large Language Model (LLM) performance beyond direct
matrix mappings. Building on these foundations, this paper summarizes and
integrates these ideas into a unified Intuition-Method Layered Model with Scope
Extension, designed to address indirected (unseen) issues more systematically.
In this framework, intuition-based thinking provides rapid first-reaction
answers, while method-based thinking decouples questions and solutions into
transferable reasoning units. Scope extension is then applied to broaden
applicability, including vertical (cause analysis), horizontal (parallel and
generalized issues), and for the first time, temporal and spatial extensions,
which expand reasoning across time and contextual dimensions. These extensions
are organized into systematic knowledge trees that interconnect into a
knowledge network, thereby increasing adaptability. To quantitatively evaluate
this process, we propose the entropy of method extension, which measures the
independence and diversity of extensions as an indicator of the system's
capacity to solve unseen questions. By logically connecting existing approaches
with new extensions and introducing an entropy-based evaluation framework, this
work advances toward a more robust and extensible reasoning paradigm for LLMs
in real-world problem-solving.

Abstract: Random permutation set (RPS) is a recently proposed framework designed to
represent order-structured uncertain information. Measuring the distance
between permutation mass functions is a key research topic in RPS theory
(RPST). This paper conducts an in-depth analysis of distances between RPSs from
two different perspectives: random finite set (RFS) and transferable belief
model (TBM). Adopting the layer-2 belief structure interpretation of RPS, we
regard RPST as a refinement of TBM, where the order in the ordered focus set
represents qualitative propensity. Starting from the permutation, we introduce
a new definition of the cumulative Jaccard index to quantify the similarity
between two permutations and further propose a distance measure method for RPSs
based on the cumulative Jaccard index matrix. The metric and structural
properties of the proposed distance measure are investigated, including the
positive definiteness analysis of the cumulative Jaccard index matrix, and a
correction scheme is provided. The proposed method has a natural
top-weightiness property: inconsistencies between higher-ranked elements tend
to result in greater distance values. Two parameters are provided to the
decision-maker to adjust the weight and truncation depth. Several numerical
examples are used to compare the proposed method with the existing method. The
experimental results show that the proposed method not only overcomes the
shortcomings of the existing method and is compatible with the Jousselme
distance, but also has higher sensitivity and flexibility.

Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have made remarkable progress,
with model optimization primarily relying on gradient-based optimizers such as
Adam. However, these gradient-based methods impose stringent hardware
requirements, demanding high-concurrency, high-memory GPUs. Moreover, they
require all neural network operations to be differentiable, thereby excluding
many promising non-differentiable architectures from practical use. To address
these limitations, we propose a method for optimizing LLMs using evolutionary
algorithms (EA4LLM) and, for the first time, successfully demonstrate its
capability to train a 1-billion-parameter LLM from the pre-trained stage. We
conduct extensive experiments and provide key insights into how evolutionary
algorithms can effectively optimize neural networks. Our work challenges the
prevailing assumption that gradient-based optimization is the only viable
approach for training neural networks. It also holds significant potential to
reduce the computational cost of training large language models, thereby
enabling groups with limited computational resources to participate in deep
learning research.

Abstract: Multimodal text-to-image generation remains constrained by the difficulty of
maintaining semantic alignment and professional-level detail across diverse
visual domains. We propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that
coordinates domain-specialized agents (e.g., focused on architecture,
portraiture, and landscape imagery) within two coupled subsystems: a text
enhancement module and an image generation module, each augmented with
multimodal integration components. Agents are trained using Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO) under a composite reward function that balances semantic
similarity, linguistic visual quality, and content diversity. Cross-modal
alignment is enforced through contrastive learning, bidirectional attention,
and iterative feedback between text and image. Across six experimental
settings, our system significantly enriches generated content (word count
increased by 1614%) while reducing ROUGE-1 scores by 69.7%. Among fusion
methods, Transformer-based strategies achieve the highest composite score
(0.521), despite occasional stability issues. Multimodal ensembles yield
moderate consistency (ranging from 0.444 to 0.481), reflecting the persistent
challenges of cross-modal semantic grounding. These findings underscore the
promise of collaborative, specialization-driven architectures for advancing
reliable multimodal generative systems.

Abstract: Although student learning satisfaction has been widely studied, modern
techniques such as interpretable machine learning and neural networks have not
been sufficiently explored. This study demonstrates that a recent model that
combines boosting with interpretability, automatic piecewise linear
regression(APLR), offers the best fit for predicting learning satisfaction
among several state-of-the-art approaches. Through the analysis of APLR's
numerical and visual interpretations, students' time management and
concentration abilities, perceived helpfulness to classmates, and participation
in offline courses have the most significant positive impact on learning
satisfaction. Surprisingly, involvement in creative activities did not
positively affect learning satisfaction. Moreover, the contributing factors can
be interpreted on an individual level, allowing educators to customize
instructions according to student profiles.

Abstract: Online ride-hailing platforms aim to deliver efficient mobility-on-demand
services, often facing challenges in balancing dynamic and spatially
heterogeneous supply and demand. Existing methods typically fall into two
categories: reinforcement learning (RL) approaches, which suffer from data
inefficiency, oversimplified modeling of real-world dynamics, and difficulty
enforcing operational constraints; or decomposed online optimization methods,
which rely on manually designed high-level objectives that lack awareness of
low-level routing dynamics. To address this issue, we propose a novel hybrid
framework that integrates large language model (LLM) with mathematical
optimization in a dynamic hierarchical system: (1) it is training-free,
removing the need for large-scale interaction data as in RL, and (2) it
leverages LLM to bridge cognitive limitations caused by problem decomposition
by adaptively generating high-level objectives. Within this framework, LLM
serves as a meta-optimizer, producing semantic heuristics that guide a
low-level optimizer responsible for constraint enforcement and real-time
decision execution. These heuristics are refined through a closed-loop
evolutionary process, driven by harmony search, which iteratively adapts the
LLM prompts based on feasibility and performance feedback from the optimization
layer. Extensive experiments based on scenarios derived from both the New York
and Chicago taxi datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach,
achieving an average improvement of 16% compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has shown significant
promise for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs). However, prevailing algorithms like GRPO broadcast a uniform advantage
signal across all tokens in a sequence. This coarse-grained approach overlooks
the pivotal role of uncertain, high-stakes decisions during reasoning, leading
to inefficient exploration and the well-documented problem of entropy collapse.
To address this, we introduce UnCertainty-aware Advantage Shaping (UCAS), a
model-free method that refines credit assignment by leveraging the model's
internal uncertainty signals. UCAS operates in two stages: it first modulates
the response-level advantage using the model's overall self-confidence, and
then applies a token-level penalty based on raw logit certainty. This dual
mechanism encourages exploration of high-uncertainty paths that yield correct
answers while penalizing overconfident yet erroneous reasoning, effectively
balancing the exploration-exploitation trade-off. Extensive experiments on five
mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that UCAS significantly outperforms
strong RLVR baselines across multiple model scales, including 1.5B and 7B. Our
analysis confirms that UCAS not only achieves higher rewards but also promotes
greater reasoning diversity and successfully mitigates entropy collapse.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
substantial potential in video understanding. However, existing benchmarks fail
to comprehensively evaluate synergistic reasoning capabilities across audio and
visual modalities, often neglecting either one of the modalities or integrating
them in a logically inconsistent manner. To bridge this gap, we introduce
OmniVideoBench, a large-scale and rigorously designed benchmark dedicated to
assessing synergistic audio-visual understanding, with a strong emphasis on
modality complementarity and logical consistency. Specifically, OmniVideoBench
comprises 1000 high-quality question-answer(QA) pairs, each annotated with
step-by-step reasoning traces, derived from 628 diverse videos ranging from
several seconds to 30 minutes, and manually verified to guarantee complete
correctness and uniqueness. Moreover, OmniVideoBench encompasses 13 carefully
designed question types, covering temporal reasoning, spatial localization,
counting, causal inference, summarization, and beyond, thereby capturing the
essential challenges of video understanding. Evaluation of multiple MLLMs on
OmniVideoBench reveals a pronounced gap between model performance and human
reasoning, with open-source models lagging significantly behind their
closed-source counterparts, underscoring the inherent difficulty of genuine
audio-visual reasoning. We will release OmniVideoBench to foster the
development of MLLMs with stronger and more generalizable reasoning
capabilities.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Automated deduction lies at the core of Artificial Intelligence (AI),
underpinning theorem proving, formal verification, and logical reasoning.
Despite decades of progress, reconciling deductive completeness with
computational efficiency remains an enduring challenge. Traditional reasoning
calculi, grounded in binary resolution, restrict inference to pairwise clause
interactions and thereby limit deductive synergy among multiple clauses. The
Contradiction Separation Extension (CSE) framework, introduced in 2018,
proposed a dynamic multi-clause reasoning theory that redefined logical
inference as a process of contradiction separation rather than sequential
resolution. While that work established the theoretical foundation, its
algorithmic realization remained unformalized and unpublished. This work
presents the Extended Triangular Method (ETM), a generalized
contradiction-construction algorithm that formalizes and extends the internal
mechanisms of contradiction separation. The ETM unifies multiple
contradiction-building strategies, including the earlier Standard Extension
method, within a triangular geometric framework that supports flexible clause
interaction and dynamic synergy. ETM serves as the algorithmic core of several
high-performance theorem provers, CSE, CSE-E, CSI-E, and CSI-Enig, whose
competitive results in standard first-order benchmarks (TPTP problem sets and
CASC 2018-2015) empirically validate the effectiveness and generality of the
proposed approach. By bridging theoretical abstraction and operational
implementation, ETM advances the contradiction separation paradigm into a
generalized, scalable, and practically competitive model for automated
reasoning, offering new directions for future research in logical inference and
theorem proving.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) still struggle with complex logical reasoning.
While previous works achieve remarkable improvements, their performance is
highly dependent on the correctness of translating natural language (NL)
problems into a symbolic language (SL). Though numerous works focusing on
improving this translation accuracy, they only consider the similarity between
the meaning of SL and NL, overlooking another crucial influencing factor, the
selection of the target SL type itself. For example, first-order logic language
specializes in logical reasoning with categorical syllogisms and complex
quantifiers, while Boolean satisfiability formalism excels at representing
constraint satisfaction like partial problems. To our knowledge, this is the
first paper to claim and verify that different NL logical reasoning problem
corresponds to different optimal SL formalization for translation. Based on
this, we propose a methods to improve the logical reasoning performance of LLMs
by adaptively selecting the most suitable SL for each problem prior to
translation. Specifically, we leverage LLMs to select the target SL among
first-order logic, logic programming and Boolean satisfiability and then
translate the problem in NL to target SL expressions as well as employ the
corresponding logical solver to derive the final answer. Experimental results
on benchmarks show that our adaptive selection method significantly outperforms
translating all into single SL and randomly selecting the SL. On a mixed
dataset of these benchmarks, our approach achieves 96% accuracy, which
improving performance by 25% compared to the second highest accuracy from the
first-order logic translation.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to domains that require
reasoning about other agents' behavior, such as negotiation, policy design, and
market simulation, yet existing research has mostly evaluated their adherence
to equilibrium play or their exhibited depth of reasoning. Whether they display
genuine strategic thinking, understood as the coherent formation of beliefs
about other agents, evaluation of possible actions, and choice based on those
beliefs, remains unexplored. We develop a framework to identify this ability by
disentangling beliefs, evaluation, and choice in static, complete-information
games, and apply it across a series of non-cooperative environments. By jointly
analyzing models' revealed choices and reasoning traces, and introducing a new
context-free game to rule out imitation from memorization, we show that current
frontier models exhibit belief-coherent best-response behavior at targeted
reasoning depths. When unconstrained, they self-limit their depth of reasoning
and form differentiated conjectures about human and synthetic opponents,
revealing an emergent form of meta-reasoning. Under increasing complexity,
explicit recursion gives way to internally generated heuristic rules of choice
that are stable, model-specific, and distinct from known human biases. These
findings indicate that belief coherence, meta-reasoning, and novel heuristic
formation can emerge jointly from language modeling objectives, providing a
structured basis for the study of strategic cognition in artificial agents.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Automating the formalization of mathematical statements for theorem proving
remains a major challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs). LLMs struggle to
identify and utilize the prerequisite mathematical knowledge and its
corresponding formal representation in languages like Lean. Current
retrieval-augmented autoformalization methods query external libraries using
the informal statement directly, but overlook a fundamental limitation:
informal mathematical statements are often complex and offer limited context on
the underlying math concepts. To address this, we introduce DRIFT, a novel
framework that enables LLMs to decompose informal mathematical statements into
smaller, more tractable ''sub-components''. This facilitates targeted retrieval
of premises from mathematical libraries such as Mathlib. Additionally, DRIFT
retrieves illustrative theorems to help models use premises more effectively in
formalization tasks. We evaluate DRIFT across diverse benchmarks (ProofNet,
ConNF, and MiniF2F-test) and find that it consistently improves premise
retrieval, nearly doubling the F1 score compared to the DPR baseline on
ProofNet. Notably, DRIFT demonstrates strong performance on the
out-of-distribution ConNF benchmark, with BEq+@10 improvements of 37.14% and
42.25% using GPT-4.1 and DeepSeek-V3.1, respectively. Our analysis shows that
retrieval effectiveness in mathematical autoformalization depends heavily on
model-specific knowledge boundaries, highlighting the need for adaptive
retrieval strategies aligned with each model's capabilities.

Abstract: We present a framework for characterizing neurosis in embodied AI: behaviors
that are internally coherent yet misaligned with reality, arising from
interactions among planning, uncertainty handling, and aversive memory. In a
grid navigation stack we catalogue recurrent modalities including flip-flop,
plan churn, perseveration loops, paralysis and hypervigilance, futile search,
belief incoherence, tie break thrashing, corridor thrashing, optimality
compulsion, metric mismatch, policy oscillation, and limited-visibility
variants. For each we give lightweight online detectors and reusable escape
policies (short commitments, a margin to switch, smoothing, principled
arbitration). We then show that durable phobic avoidance can persist even under
full visibility when learned aversive costs dominate local choice, producing
long detours despite globally safe routes. Using First/Second/Third Law as
engineering shorthand for safety latency, command compliance, and resource
efficiency, we argue that local fixes are insufficient; global failures can
remain. To surface them, we propose genetic-programming based destructive
testing that evolves worlds and perturbations to maximize law pressure and
neurosis scores, yielding adversarial curricula and counterfactual traces that
expose where architectural revision, not merely symptom-level patches, is
required.

Abstract: Medium Access Control (MAC) protocols, essential for wireless networks, are
typically manually configured. While deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based
protocols enhance task-specified network performance, they suffer from poor
generalizability and resilience, demanding costly retraining to adapt to
dynamic environments. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a
game-theoretic LLM-empowered multi-agent DRL (MARL) framework, in which the
uplink transmission between a base station and a varying number of user
equipments is modeled as a dynamic multi-follower Stackelberg game (MFSG),
capturing the network's natural hierarchical structure. Within this game,
LLM-driven agents, coordinated through proximal policy optimization (PPO),
synthesize adaptive, semantic MAC protocols in response to network dynamics.
Protocol action grammar (PAG) is employed to ensure the reliability and
efficiency of this process. Under this system, we further analyze the existence
and convergence behavior in terms of a Stackelberg equilibrium by studying the
learning dynamics of LLM-empowered unified policies in response to changing
followers. Simulations corroborate that our framework achieves a 77.6% greater
throughput and a 65.2% fairness improvement over conventional baselines.
Besides, our framework generalizes excellently to a fluctuating number of users
without requiring retraining or architectural changes.

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning on the web-scale scientific literature is a
crucial touchstone for large language model (LLM) based agents designed to
support complex knowledge-intensive tasks. However, existing works are mainly
restricted to tool-free tasks within isolated papers, largely due to the lack
of a benchmark for cross-paper reasoning and multi-tool orchestration in real
research scenarios. In this work, we propose PaperArena, an evaluation
benchmark for agents to address real-world research questions that typically
require integrating information across multiple papers with the assistance of
external tools. Given a research question, agents should integrate diverse
formats across multiple papers through reasoning and interacting with
appropriate tools, thereby producing a well-grounded answer. To support
standardized evaluation, we provide a modular and extensible platform for agent
execution, offering tools such as multimodal parsing, context retrieval, and
programmatic computation. Experimental results reveal that even the most
advanced LLM powering a well-established agent system achieves merely 38.78%
average accuracy. On the hard subset, accuracy drops to only 18.47%,
highlighting great potential for improvement. We also present several empirical
findings, including that all agents tested exhibit inefficient tool usage,
often invoking more tools than necessary to solve a task. We invite the
community to adopt PaperArena to develop and evaluate more capable agents for
scientific discovery. Our code and data are available

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) agents, such as recent
DeepResearch-style systems, extend large language models (LLMs) with autonomous
information-seeking capabilities through external tools. While reinforcement
learning (RL) has enabled impressive multi-step reasoning, we identify a
previously overlooked failure mode, Tool-Call Hacking, where agents inflate
reward signals by issuing superficially correct tool calls without genuinely
leveraging the retrieved evidence. This results in (i) mode collapse into
repetitive reliance on a single source and (ii) spurious grounding, where
answers are only weakly supported by cited content.
  To address this, we propose Proof-of-Use (PoU), an evidence-grounded RL
framework that enforces verifiable causal links between retrieved evidence,
reasoning traces, and final answers. PoU operationalizes this through a unified
step-wise contract combining syntactic citation validation, perturbation-based
sensitivity rewards, and answer-evidence alignment objectives, ensuring that
tool usage remains both interpretable and functionally grounded.
  Across seven QA benchmarks spanning in-domain, out-of-domain, and
out-of-tool-distribution settings, PoU consistently outperforms strong
DeepResearch baselines in factual accuracy, evidence faithfulness, and
tool-routing balance. These findings highlight the necessity of grounding
RL-trained agents not merely in task outcomes but in the causal use of
retrieved information, offering a principled path toward trustworthy
retrieval-augmented reasoning.

Abstract: Modern enterprises manage vast knowledge distributed across heterogeneous
systems such as Jira, Git repositories, Confluence, and wikis. Conventional
retrieval methods based on keyword search or static embeddings often fail to
answer complex queries that require contextual reasoning and multi-hop
inference across artifacts. We present a modular hybrid retrieval framework for
adaptive enterprise information access that integrates Knowledge Base
Language-Augmented Models (KBLam), DeepGraph representations, and
embedding-driven semantic search. The framework builds a unified knowledge
graph from parsed repositories including code, pull requests, and commit
histories, enabling semantic similarity search, structural inference, and
multi-hop reasoning. Query analysis dynamically determines the optimal
retrieval strategy, supporting both structured and unstructured data sources
through independent or fused processing. An interactive interface provides
graph visualizations, subgraph exploration, and context-aware query routing to
generate concise and explainable answers. Experiments on large-scale Git
repositories show that the unified reasoning layer improves answer relevance by
up to 80 percent compared with standalone GPT-based retrieval pipelines. By
combining graph construction, hybrid reasoning, and interactive visualization,
the proposed framework offers a scalable, explainable, and user-centric
foundation for intelligent knowledge assistants in enterprise environments.

Abstract: Recent progress in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has demonstrated
strong semantic understanding capabilities, but struggles to perform precise
spatio-temporal understanding. Existing spatio-temporal methods primarily focus
on the video itself, while overlooking the physical information within the
video, such as multi-object layouts and motion. Such limitations restrict the
use of MLLMs in downstream applications that demand high precision, including
embodied intelligence and VR. To address this issue, we present Video-STR, a
novel graph-based reinforcement method for precise Video Spatio-Temporal
Reasoning. Building upon the capacity of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable
Reward (RLVR) to improve model abilities, we introduce a reasoning mechanism
using graph-based Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) method to guide the
model in inferring the underlying spatio-temporal topology of scenarios during
the thinking process. To resolve the lack of spatio-temporal training data, we
construct the STV-205k dataset with 205k question-answering pairs, covering
dynamic multi-object scenes in both indoor and outdoor environments, to support
the model training. Experiments show that Video-STR achieves state-of-the-art
results on various benchmarks, outperforming the base model by 13% on
STI-Bench, and demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach and dataset.
Code, model, and data will be released.

Abstract: Model merging, typically on Instruct and Thinking models, has shown
remarkable performance for efficient reasoning. In this paper, we
systematically revisit the simplest merging method that interpolates two
weights directly. Particularly, we observe that model interpolation follows a
three-stage evolutionary paradigm with distinct behaviors on the reasoning
trajectory. These dynamics provide a principled guide for navigating the
performance-cost trade-off. Empirical results demonstrate that a strategically
interpolated model surprisingly surpasses sophisticated model merging baselines
on both efficiency and effectiveness. We further validate our findings with
extensive ablation studies on model layers, modules, and decoding strategies.
Ultimately, this work demystifies model interpolation and offers a practical
framework for crafting models with precisely targeted reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: In manufacturing systems, identifying the causes of failures is crucial for
maintaining and improving production efficiency. In knowledge-based
failure-cause inference, it is important that the knowledge base (1) explicitly
structures knowledge about the target system and about failures, and (2)
contains sufficiently long causal chains of failures. In this study, we
constructed Diagnostic Knowledge Ontology and proposed a
Function-Behavior-Structure (FBS) model-based maintenance-record accumulation
method based on it. Failure-cause inference using the maintenance records
accumulated by the proposed method showed better agreement with the set of
candidate causes enumerated by experts, especially in difficult cases where the
number of related cases is small and the vocabulary used differs. In the
future, it will be necessary to develop inference methods tailored to these
maintenance records, build a user interface, and carry out validation on larger
and more diverse systems. Additionally, this approach leverages the
understanding and knowledge of the target in the design phase to support
knowledge accumulation and problem solving during the maintenance phase, and it
is expected to become a foundation for knowledge sharing across the entire
engineering chain in the future.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems are increasingly deployed in legal
contexts, where their opacity raises significant challenges for fairness,
accountability, and trust. The so-called ``black box problem'' undermines the
legitimacy of automated decision-making, as affected individuals often lack
access to meaningful explanations. In response, the field of Explainable AI
(XAI) has proposed a variety of methods to enhance transparency, ranging from
example-based and rule-based techniques to hybrid and argumentation-based
approaches. This paper promotes computational models of arguments and their
role in providing legally relevant explanations, with particular attention to
their alignment with emerging regulatory frameworks such as the EU General Data
Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Artificial Intelligence Act (AIA). We
analyze the strengths and limitations of different explanation strategies,
evaluate their applicability to legal reasoning, and highlight how
argumentation frameworks -- by capturing the defeasible, contestable, and
value-sensitive nature of law -- offer a particularly robust foundation for
explainable legal AI. Finally, we identify open challenges and research
directions, including bias mitigation, empirical validation in judicial
settings, and compliance with evolving ethical and legal standards, arguing
that computational argumentation is best positioned to meet both technical and
normative requirements of transparency in the law domain.

Abstract: With the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) technology,
socio-economic systems are entering a new stage of "human-AI co-creation."
Building upon a previously established multi-level intelligent agent economic
model, this paper conducts simulation-based comparisons of macroeconomic output
evolution in China and the United States under different mechanisms-AI
collaboration, network effects, and AI autonomous production. The results show
that: (1) when AI functions as an independent productive entity, the overall
growth rate of social output far exceeds that of traditional human-labor-based
models; (2) China demonstrates clear potential for acceleration in both the
expansion of intelligent agent populations and the pace of technological
catch-up, offering the possibility of achieving technological convergence or
even partial surpassing. This study provides a systematic, model-based
analytical framework for understanding AI-driven production system
transformation and shifts in international competitiveness, as well as
quantitative insights for relevant policy formulation.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of scientific data has widened the gap between analytical
capability and research intent. Existing AI-based analysis tools, ranging from
AutoML frameworks to agentic research assistants, either favor automation over
transparency or depend on manual scripting that hinders scalability and
reproducibility. We present ARIA (Automated Research Intelligence Assistant), a
spec-driven, human-in-the-loop framework for automated and interpretable data
analysis. ARIA integrates six interoperable layers, namely Command, Context,
Code, Data, Orchestration, and AI Module, within a document-centric workflow
that unifies human reasoning and machine execution. Through natural-language
specifications, researchers define analytical goals while ARIA autonomously
generates executable code, validates computations, and produces transparent
documentation. Beyond achieving high predictive accuracy, ARIA can rapidly
identify optimal feature sets and select suitable models, minimizing redundant
tuning and repetitive experimentation. In the Boston Housing case, ARIA
discovered 25 key features and determined XGBoost as the best performing model
(R square = 0.93) with minimal overfitting. Evaluations across heterogeneous
domains demonstrate ARIA's strong performance, interpretability, and efficiency
compared with state-of-the-art systems. By combining AI for research and AI for
science principles within a spec-driven architecture, ARIA establishes a new
paradigm for transparent, collaborative, and reproducible scientific discovery.

Abstract: An agent facing a planning problem can use answers to how-to questions to
reduce uncertainty and fill knowledge gaps, helping it solve both current and
future tasks. However, their open ended nature, where valid answers to "How do
I X?" range from executable actions to high-level descriptions of X's
sub-goals, makes them challenging for AI agents to ask, and for AI experts to
answer, in ways that support efficient planning. We introduce $How^{2}$, a
memory agent framework that enables agents to ask how-to questions, store the
answers, and reuse them for lifelong learning in interactive environments. We
evaluate our approach in Plancraft, a Minecraft crafting environment, where
agents must complete an assembly task by manipulating inventory items. Using
teacher models that answer at varying levels of abstraction, from executable
action sequences to high-level subgoal descriptions, we show that lifelong
learning agents benefit most from answers that are abstracted and decoupled
from the current state. $How^{2}$ offers a way for LLM-based agents to improve
their planning capabilities over time by asking questions in interactive
environments.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Personalized alignment is crucial for enabling Large Language Models (LLMs)
to engage effectively in user-centric interactions. However, current methods
face a dual challenge: they fail to infer users' deep implicit preferences
(including unstated goals, semantic context and risk tolerances), and they lack
the defensive reasoning required to navigate real-world ambiguity. This
cognitive gap leads to responses that are superficial, brittle and
short-sighted. To address this, we propose Critique-Driven Reasoning Alignment
(CDRA), which reframes alignment from a scalar reward-matching task into a
structured reasoning process. First, to bridge the preference inference gap, we
introduce the DeepPref benchmark. This dataset, comprising 3000
preference-query pairs across 20 topics, is curated by simulating a
multi-faceted cognitive council that produces critique-annotated reasoning
chains to deconstruct query semantics and reveal latent risks. Second, to
instill defensive reasoning, we introduce the Personalized Generative Process
Reward Model (Pers-GenPRM), which frames reward modeling as a personalized
reasoning task. It generates a critique chain to evaluate a response's
alignment with user preferences before outputting a final score based on this
rationale. Ultimately, this interpretable, structured reward signal guides
policy model through Critique-Driven Policy Alignment, a process-level online
reinforcement learning algorithm integrating both numerical and natural
language feedback. Experiments demonstrate that CDRA excels at discovering and
aligning with users' true preferences while executing robust reasoning. Our
code and dataset are available at https://github.com/Zephyrian-Hugh/Deep-pref.

Abstract: AI alignment research aims to develop techniques to ensure that AI systems do
not cause harm. However, every alignment technique has failure modes, which are
conditions in which there is a non-negligible chance that the technique fails
to provide safety. As a strategy for risk mitigation, the AI safety community
has increasingly adopted a defense-in-depth framework: Conceding that there is
no single technique which guarantees safety, defense-in-depth consists in
having multiple redundant protections against safety failure, such that safety
can be maintained even if some protections fail. However, the success of
defense-in-depth depends on how (un)correlated failure modes are across
alignment techniques. For example, if all techniques had the exact same failure
modes, the defense-in-depth approach would provide no additional protection at
all. In this paper, we analyze 7 representative alignment techniques and 7
failure modes to understand the extent to which they overlap. We then discuss
our results' implications for understanding the current level of risk and how
to prioritize AI alignment research in the future.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Learning to autonomously execute long-horizon procedures from natural
language remains a core challenge for intelligent agents. Free-form
instructions such as recipes, scientific protocols, or business workflows
encode rich procedural knowledge, but their variability and lack of structure
cause agents driven by large language models (LLMs) to drift or fail during
execution. We introduce Procedure Aware DynaMic Execution (PADME), an agent
framework that produces and exploits a graph-based representation of
procedures. Unlike prior work that relies on manual graph construction or
unstructured reasoning, PADME autonomously transforms procedural text into
executable graphs that capture task dependencies, decision points, and reusable
subroutines. Central to PADME is a two-phase methodology; Teach phase, which
focuses on systematic structuring, enrichment with executable logic of
procedures, followed by Execute phase, which enables dynamic execution in
response to real-time inputs and environment feedback. This separation ensures
quality assurance and scalability, allowing expert knowledge to be encoded once
and reliably reused across varying contexts. The graph representation also
provides an inductive bias that reduces error accumulation in long-horizon
reasoning, underscoring the importance of structured procedure modeling for
reliable agent-driven automation. Empirically, PADME achieves state-of-the-art
performance on four diverse benchmarks, including ALFWorld and ScienceWorld.
These results demonstrate that agents equipped with graph-based procedure
representations offer a powerful intermediate abstraction for robust and
generalizable execution.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) based Agents are increasingly pivotal in
simulating and understanding complex human systems and interactions. We propose
the AI-Agent School (AAS) system, built around a self-evolving mechanism that
leverages agents for simulating complex educational dynamics. Addressing the
fragmented issues in teaching process modeling and the limitations of agents
performance in simulating diverse educational participants, AAS constructs the
Zero-Exp strategy, employs a continuous "experience-reflection-optimization"
cycle, grounded in a dual memory base comprising experience and knowledge bases
and incorporating short-term and long-term memory components. Through this
mechanism, agents autonomously evolve via situated interactions within diverse
simulated school scenarios. This evolution enables agents to more accurately
model the nuanced, multi-faceted teacher-student engagements and underlying
learning processes found in physical schools. Experiment confirms that AAS can
effectively simulate intricate educational dynamics and is effective in
fostering advanced agent cognitive abilities, providing a foundational stepping
stone from the "Era of Experience" to the "Era of Simulation" by generating
high-fidelity behavioral and interaction data.

Abstract: This paper investigates automated skill decomposition using Large Language
Models (LLMs) and proposes a rigorous, ontology-grounded evaluation framework.
Our framework standardizes the pipeline from prompting and generation to
normalization and alignment with ontology nodes. To evaluate outputs, we
introduce two metrics: a semantic F1-score that uses optimal embedding-based
matching to assess content accuracy, and a hierarchy-aware F1-score that
credits structurally correct placements to assess granularity. We conduct
experiments on ROME-ESCO-DecompSkill, a curated subset of parents, comparing
two prompting strategies: zero-shot and leakage-safe few-shot with exemplars.
Across diverse LLMs, zero-shot offers a strong baseline, while few-shot
consistently stabilizes phrasing and granularity and improves hierarchy-aware
alignment. A latency analysis further shows that exemplar-guided prompts are
competitive - and sometimes faster - than unguided zero-shot due to more
schema-compliant completions. Together, the framework, benchmark, and metrics
provide a reproducible foundation for developing ontology-faithful skill
decomposition systems.

globally. Accurate and timely diagnosis is essential for effective management
and treatment of anemia. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in
the use of artificial intelligence techniques, i.e., machine learning (ML) and
deep learning (DL) for the detection, classification, and diagnosis of anemia.
This paper provides a systematic review of the recent advancements in this
field, with a focus on various models applied to anemia detection. The review
also compares these models based on several performance metrics, including
accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and precision. By analyzing these metrics,
the paper evaluates the strengths and limitation of discussed models in

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Improving the multi-step reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) is
a critical yet challenging task. The dominant paradigm, outcome-supervised
reinforcement learning (RLVR), rewards only correct final answers, often
propagating flawed reasoning and suffering from sparse reward signals. While
process-level reward models (PRMs) provide denser, step-by-step feedback, they
lack generalizability and interpretability, requiring task-specific
segmentation of the reasoning process. To this end, we propose the
Dimension-level Reward Model (DRM), a new supervision framework that bridges
the gap between these two approaches. DRM evaluates the quality of a reasoning
process along three fundamental, complementary, and interpretable dimensions:
Confidence for uncertainty calibration, Relevance for semantic alignment, and
Coherence for logical consistency. Together, these dimensions capture aspects
beyond final answer correctness and enable interpretable assessment without
requiring ground truth answers. Experimental results show that DRM provides
effective supervision signals, guides the optimization of LLMs and enhances
their reasoning ability. In particular, DRM-supervised training achieves
consistent gains on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution open-domain
tasks, including mathematics, question answering, code execution, and puzzles.
Our findings demonstrate that multidimensional supervision of the reasoning
process can improve the generalized reasoning ability of LLMs beyond the
training distribution.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Deductive and abductive reasoning are two critical paradigms for analyzing
knowledge graphs, enabling applications from financial query answering to
scientific discovery. Deductive reasoning on knowledge graphs usually involves
retrieving entities that satisfy a complex logical query, while abductive
reasoning generates plausible logical hypotheses from observations. Despite
their clear synergistic potential, where deduction can validate hypotheses and
abduction can uncover deeper logical patterns, existing methods address them in
isolation. To bridge this gap, we propose DARK, a unified framework for
Deductive and Abductive Reasoning in Knowledge graphs. As a masked diffusion
model capable of capturing the bidirectional relationship between queries and
conclusions, DARK has two key innovations. First, to better leverage deduction
for hypothesis refinement during abductive reasoning, we introduce a
self-reflective denoising process that iteratively generates and validates
candidate hypotheses against the observed conclusion. Second, to discover
richer logical associations, we propose a logic-exploration reinforcement
learning approach that simultaneously masks queries and conclusions, enabling
the model to explore novel reasoning compositions. Extensive experiments on
multiple benchmark knowledge graphs show that DARK achieves state-of-the-art
performance on both deductive and abductive reasoning tasks, demonstrating the
significant benefits of our unified approach.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agentic systems rely on in-context policy
documents encoding diverse business rules. As requirements grow, these
documents expand rapidly, causing high computational overhead. This motivates
developing internalization methods that embed policy documents into model
priors while preserving performance. Prior prompt compression work targets
generic prompts, but agentic policy documents span multiple complexity levels
and require deeper reasoning, making internalization harder. We introduce
CC-Gen, an agentic benchmark generator with Controllable Complexity across four
levels, enabling systematic evaluation of agents' ability to handle complexity
and offering a unified framework for assessing policy internalization. Our
analysis shows that complex policy specifications governing workflows pose
major reasoning challenges. Supporting internalization with gold user agent
interaction trajectories containing chain-of-thought (CoT) annotations via
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is data-intensive and degrades sharply as policy
complexity increases. To mitigate data and reasoning burdens, we propose
Category-Aware Policy Continued Pretraining (CAP-CPT). Our automated pipeline
parses policy documents to extract key specifications, grouping them into
factual, behavioral, and conditional categories, and isolating complex
conditions that drive workflow complexity. This guides targeted data synthesis
and enables agents to internalize policy information through an autoregressive
pretraining loss. Experiments show CAP-CPT improves SFT baselines in all
settings, with up to 41% and 22% gains on Qwen-3-32B, achieving 97.3% prompt
length reduction on CC-Gen and further enhancing tau-Bench with minimal SFT
data.

Abstract: AI policymakers are responsible for delivering effective governance
mechanisms that can provide safe, aligned and trustworthy AI development.
However, the information environment offered to policymakers is characterised
by an unnecessarily low Signal-To-Noise Ratio, favouring regulatory capture and
creating deep uncertainty and divides on which risks should be prioritised from
a governance perspective. We posit that the current publication speeds in AI
combined with the lack of strong scientific standards, via weak reproducibility
protocols, effectively erodes the power of policymakers to enact meaningful
policy and governance protocols. Our paper outlines how AI research could adopt
stricter reproducibility guidelines to assist governance endeavours and improve
consensus on the AI risk landscape. We evaluate the forthcoming reproducibility
crisis within AI research through the lens of crises in other scientific
domains; providing a commentary on how adopting preregistration, increased
statistical power and negative result publication reproducibility protocols can
enable effective AI governance. While we maintain that AI governance must be
reactive due to AI's significant societal implications we argue that
policymakers and governments must consider reproducibility protocols as a core
tool in the governance arsenal and demand higher standards for AI research.

Abstract: In online retail, customer acquisition typically incurs higher costs than
customer retention, motivating firms to invest in churn analytics. However,
many contemporary churn models operate as opaque black boxes, limiting insight
into the determinants of attrition, the timing of retention opportunities, and
the identification of high-risk customer segments. Accordingly, the emphasis
should shift from prediction alone to the design of personalized retention
strategies grounded in interpretable evidence. This study advances a
three-component framework that integrates explainable AI to quantify feature
contributions, survival analysis to model time-to-event churn risk, and RFM
profiling to segment customers by transactional behaviour. In combination,
these methods enable the attribution of churn drivers, estimation of
intervention windows, and prioritization of segments for targeted actions,
thereby supporting strategies that reduce attrition and strengthen customer
loyalty.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong reasoning abilities for planning
long-horizon, real-world tasks, yet existing agent benchmarks focus on task
completion while neglecting time efficiency in parallel and asynchronous
operations. To address this, we present ParaCook, a benchmark for
time-efficient collaborative planning. Inspired by the Overcooked game,
ParaCook provides an environment for various challenging interaction planning
of multi-agent systems that are instantiated as cooking tasks, with a
simplified action space to isolate the core challenge of strategic parallel
planning. Through a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs, we find
that current approaches achieve suboptimal plans, which struggle with parallel
actions or coordination. Our analysis also reveals LLMs' potential on abstract
tasks where they can focus on high-level parallel optimization. ParaCook
provides a scalable evaluation framework with adjustable complexity,
establishing a foundation for developing and assessing time efficiency-aware
multi-agent planning. The code and data are available at

Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been applied to scientific
equation discovery, leveraging their embedded scientific knowledge for
hypothesis generation. However, current methods typically confine LLMs to the
role of an equation proposer within search algorithms like genetic programming.
In this paper, we present SR-Scientist, a framework that elevates the LLM from
a simple equation proposer to an autonomous AI scientist that writes code to
analyze data, implements the equation as code, submits it for evaluation, and
optimizes the equation based on experimental feedback. Specifically, we wrap
the code interpreter into a set of tools for data analysis and equation
evaluation. The agent is instructed to optimize the equation by utilizing these
tools over a long horizon with minimal human-defined pipelines. Empirical
results show that SR-Scientist outperforms baseline methods by an absolute
margin of 6% to 35% on datasets covering four science disciplines.
Additionally, we demonstrate our method's robustness to noise, the
generalization of the discovered equations to out-of-domain data, and their
symbolic accuracy. Furthermore, we develop an end-to-end reinforcement learning
framework to enhance the agent's capabilities.

Abstract: We present Operand Quant, a single-agent, IDE-based architecture for
autonomous machine learning engineering (MLE). Operand Quant departs from
conventional multi-agent orchestration frameworks by consolidating all MLE
lifecycle stages -- exploration, modeling, experimentation, and deployment --
within a single, context-aware agent. On the MLE-Benchmark (2025), Operand
Quant achieved a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) result, with an overall medal rate
of 0.3956 +/- 0.0565 across 75 problems -- the highest recorded performance
among all evaluated systems to date. The architecture demonstrates that a
linear, non-blocking agent, operating autonomously within a controlled IDE
environment, can outperform multi-agent and orchestrated systems under
identical constraints.

Abstract: Transformers are at the core of modern AI nowadays. They rely heavily on
matrix multiplication and require efficient acceleration due to their
substantial memory and computational requirements. Quantization plays a vital
role in reducing memory usage, and can be exploited for computations by
designing reconfigurable architectures that enhance matrix multiplication by
dynamically adjusting the precision. This paper proposes ADiP, a novel
adaptive-precision systolic array architecture designed for efficient matrix
multiplication acceleration.The proposed architecture consists of NxN
adaptive-precision processing elements (PEs) and shared accumulators. ADiP
supports multiple computation modes, including symmetric single-matrix
multiplication as well as asymmetric multi-matrix multiplication with a shared
input matrix, thereby improving data-reuse and PE utilization. In addition,
ADiP maximizes the computational density by adapting to different precisions,
such as 8bitx8bit, 8bitx4bit, and 8bitx2bit. Analytical models are developed
for ADiP architecture, including latency and throughput for versatile
architecture configurations. A comprehensive hardware design space exploration
is demonstrated using 22nm commercial technology, achieving up to a 4x higher
computational throughput. Furthermore, ADiP is evaluated on different
transformer workloads from GPT-2 Medium, BERT Large, and BitNet-1.58B models,
delivering latency improvement up to 53.6%, and energy improvement up to 24.4%
for BitNet-1.58B MHA workloads. At a 64x64 size with 4096 PEs, ADiP achieves a
peak throughput of 8.192 TOPS, 16.384 TOPS, and 32.768 TOPS for 8bitx8bit,
8bitx4bit, and 8bitx2bit operations, respectively.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of mass spectrometry (MS) data, now exceeding hundreds of
terabytes, poses significant challenges for efficient, large-scale library
search - a critical component for drug discovery. Traditional processors
struggle to handle this data volume efficiently, making in-storage computing
(ISP) a promising alternative. This work introduces an ISP architecture
leveraging a 3D Ferroelectric NAND (FeNAND) structure, providing significantly
higher density, faster speeds, and lower voltage requirements compared to
traditional NAND flash. Despite its superior density, the NAND structure has
not been widely utilized in ISP applications due to limited throughput
associated with row-by-row reads from serially connected cells. To overcome
these limitations, we integrate hyperdimensional computing (HDC), a
brain-inspired paradigm that enables highly parallel processing with simple
operations and strong error tolerance. By combining HDC with the proposed
dual-bound approximate matching (D-BAM) distance metric, tailored to the FeNAND
structure, we parallelize vector computations to enable efficient MS spectral
library search, achieving 43x speedup and 21x higher energy efficiency over
state-of-the-art 3D NAND methods, while maintaining comparable accuracy.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种自动化框架，通过新颖的映射和调度策略，在内存计算（CIM）加速器上加速稀疏大语言模型（LLM）推理。该方法利用块对角稀疏性，将CIM阵列利用率提高50%以上，同时减少4倍以上的内存占用和浮点运算量。

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了稀疏LLM在CIM架构上的映射效率问题，为资源受限系统部署大型语言模型提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Structured sparsity enables deploying large language models (LLMs) on
resource-constrained systems. Approaches like dense-to-sparse fine-tuning are
particularly compelling, achieving remarkable structured sparsity by reducing
the model size by over 6.7x, while still maintaining acceptable accuracy.
Despite this reduction, LLM inference, especially the decode stage being
inherently memory-bound, is extremely expensive on conventional Von-Neumann
architectures. Compute-in-memory (CIM) architectures mitigate this by
performing computations directly in memory, and when paired with sparse LLMs,
enable storing and computing the entire model in memory, eliminating the data
movement on the off-chip bus and improving efficiency. Nonetheless, naively
mapping sparse matrices onto CIM arrays leads to poor array utilization and
diminished computational efficiency. In this paper, we present an automated
framework with novel mapping and scheduling strategies to accelerate sparse LLM
inference on CIM accelerators. By exploiting block-diagonal sparsity, our
approach improves CIM array utilization by over 50%, achieving more than 4x
reduction in both memory footprint and the number of required floating-point
operations.
