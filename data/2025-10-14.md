Abstract: Energy efficiency has emerged as a defining constraint in the evolution of
sustainable Internet of Things (IoT) networks. This work moves beyond
simulation-based or device-centric studies to deliver measurement-driven,
network-level smart energy analysis. The proposed system enables end-to-end
visibility of energy flows across distributed IoT infrastructures, uniting
Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and Visible Light Communication (VLC) modes with
environmental sensing and E-ink display subsystems under a unified profiling
and prediction platform. Through automated, time-synchronized instrumentation,
the framework captures fine-grained energy dynamics across both node and
gateway layers. We developed a suite of tools that generate energy datasets for
IoT ecosystems, addressing the scarcity of such data and enabling AI-based
predictive and adaptive energy optimization. Validated within a network-level
IoT testbed, the approach demonstrates robust performance under real operating
conditions.

Abstract: The use of Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) has significantly increased over
the past decade, with approximately 55 million websites currently relying on
CDN services. Emerging solutions, such as Delegated Credentials (RFC 9345),
lack fine-grained definitions of many critical aspects of delegation, such as
the length of delegation chains, revocation mechanism, permitted operations,
and a well-defined scope for said delegation. We present Delegation
Certificates (DeCerts), which modify X.509 certificate standard and add new
extensions to enable fine-grained CDN delegation. DeCerts allow domain owners
to specify delegated and non-delegated subdomains, and control the depth of
delegation extended by CDNs, which provides flexibility in delegation
management. But more importantly, DeCerts are built on a new principle which
provides full autonomy to domain owners-domain owners can issue DeCerts fully
independent of Certificate Authorities (CAs), and thus have greater flexibility
in policy control, including revocation methods. Such level of flexibility
would be hard to match if CAs where to issue such certificates. Revoking a
DeCert revokes delegation. We discuss multiple revocation mechanisms for a
DeCerts balancing security, performance, and delegator control. We modify
Firefox to support DeCert (i.e., proper validation) as a proof-of-concept, and
test it to demonstrate the feasibility, compatibility of DeCerts with browsers
and TLS/HTTPS protocols. DeCerts enhance the security, scalability, and
manageability of CDN delegation, offering a practical solution for Internet
services.

Abstract: Spectrum sharing is a critical strategy for meeting escalating user demands
via commercial wireless services, yet its effective regulation and
technological enablement, particularly concerning coexistence with incumbent
systems, remain significant challenges. Federal organizations have established
regulatory frameworks to manage shared commercial use alongside
mission-critical operations, such as military communications. This paper
investigates the potential of machine learning (ML)-based approaches to enhance
spectrum sharing capabilities within the Citizens Broadband Radio Service
(CBRS) band, specifically focusing on the coexistence of commercial signals
(e.g., 5G) and military radar systems. We demonstrate that ML techniques can
potentially extend the Federal Communications Commission (FCC)-recommended
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) boundaries by improving radar
detection and waveform identification in high-interference environments.
Through rigorous evaluation using both synthetic and real-world signals, our
findings indicate that proposed ML models, utilizing In-phase/Quadrature (IQ)
data and spectrograms, can achieve the FCC-recommended $99\%$ radar detection
accuracy even when subjected to high interference from 5G signals upto -5dB
SINR, exceeding the required limits of $20$ SINR. Our experimental studies
distinguish this work from the state-of-the-art by significantly extending the
SINR limit for $99\%$ radar detection accuracy from approximately $12$ dB down
to $-5$ dB. Subsequent to detection, we further apply ML to analyze and
identify radar waveforms. The proposed models also demonstrate the capability
to classify six distinct radar waveform types with $93\%$ accuracy.

Abstract: The growing demand for effective spectrum management and interference
mitigation in shared bands, such as the Citizens Broadband Radio Service
(CBRS), requires robust radar detection algorithms to protect the military
transmission from interference due to commercial wireless transmission. These
algorithms, in turn, depend on large, diverse, and carefully labeled
spectrogram datasets. However, collecting and annotating real-world radio
frequency (RF) spectrogram data remains a significant challenge, as radar
signals are rare, and their occurrences are infrequent. This challenge makes
the creation of balanced datasets difficult, limiting the performance and
generalizability of AI models in this domain.
  To address this critical issue, we propose a diffusion-based generative model
for synthesizing realistic and diverse spectrograms of five distinct categories
that integrate LTE, 5G, and radar signals within the CBRS band. We conduct a
structural and statistical fidelity analysis of the generated spectrograms
using widely accepted evaluation metrics Structural Similarity Index Measure
(SSIM) and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), to quantify their divergence from
the training data. Furthermore, we demonstrate that pre-training on the
generated spectrograms significantly improves training efficiency on a
real-world radar detection task by enabling $51.5\%$ faster convergence.

Abstract: Flying Ad Hoc Networks (FANETs) present unique challenges due to high node
mobility, dynamic topologies, and strict resource constraints. Existing routing
protocols often optimize for a single metric, such as path length or energy,
while neglecting the complex dependencies between network performance,
security, and MAC layer efficiency. This paper introduces a novel hardware
software co design framework for secure and adaptive UAV swarm communications,
featuring an energy aware protocol stack. The architecture employs a multicast,
clustered organization where routing decisions integrate dynamic trust scores,
historical link quality, and internodal distance. A hybrid MAC protocol
combines contention based and scheduled channel access for optimized
throughput. Security is ensured through a zero trust model that fuses
cryptographic authentication with a behavioral reputation system, alongside
hardware accelerated AES GCM encryption. Comparative analysis in an NS 3
simulation environment demonstrates the framework's superiority in packet
delivery ratio, latency, resilience, and overhead, providing a scalable
foundation for high performance swarm operations.

Abstract: In the ensuing ultra-dense and diverse environment in future \ac{6G}
communication networks, it will be critical to optimize network resources via
mechanisms that recognize and cater to the diversity, density, and dynamicity
of system changes. However, coping with such environments cannot be done
through the current network approach of compartmentalizing data as distinct
from network operations. Instead, we envision a computing continuum where the
content of the transmitted data is considered as an essential element in the
transmission of that data, with data sources and streams analyzed and distilled
to their essential elements, based on their semantic context, and then
processed and transmitted over dedicated slices of network resources. By
exploiting the rich content and semantics within data for dynamic and
autonomous optimization of the computing continuum, this article opens the door
to integrating communication, computing, cyber-physical systems, data flow, and
AI, presenting new and exciting opportunities for cross-layer design. We
propose semantic slicing, a two-pronged approach that builds multiple virtual
divisions within a single physical and data infrastructure, each with its own
distinct characteristics and needs. We view semantic slicing as a novel shift
from current static slicing techniques, extending existing slicing approaches
such that it can be applied dynamically at different levels and categories of
resources in the computing continuum. Further it propels the advancement of
semantic communication via the proposed architectural framework.

Abstract: Operating at petabit-scale, ByteDance's cloud gateways are deployed at
critical aggregation points to orchestrate a wide array of business traffic.
However, this massive scale imposes significant resource pressure on our
previous-generation cloud gateways, rendering them unsustainable in the face of
ever-growing cloud-network traffic. As the DPU market rapidly expands, we see a
promising path to meet our escalating business traffic demands by integrating
DPUs with our established Tofino-based gateways. DPUs augment these gateways
with substantially larger table capacities and richer programmability without
compromising previously low-latency and high-throughput forwarding. Despite
compelling advantages, the practical integration of DPUs into cloud gateways
remains unexplored, primarily due to underlying challenges. In this paper, we
present Zephyrus, a production-scale gateway built upon a unified P4 pipeline
spanning high-performance Tofino and feature-rich DPUs, which successfully
overcomes these challenges. We further introduce a hierarchical co-offloading
architecture (HLCO) to orchestrate traffic flow within this heterogeneous
gateway, achieving > 99% hardware offloading while retaining software fallback
paths for complex operations. Zephyrus outperforms LuoShen (NSDI '24) with 33%
higher throughput and our evaluation further indicates 21% lower power
consumption and 14% lower hardware cost. Against FPGA-based systems, Albatross
(SIGCOMM '25), it doubles the throughput at a substantially lower Total Cost of
Ownership (TCO), showcasing its superior performance-per-dollar. Beyond these
performance gains, we also share key lessons from several years of developing
and operating Zephyrus at production scale. We believe these insights provide
valuable references for researchers and practitioners designing performant
cloud gateways.

Abstract: The increase of bandwidth-intensive applications in sixth-generation (6G)
wireless networks, such as real-time volumetric streaming and multi-sensory
extended reality, demands intelligent multicast routing solutions capable of
delivering differentiated quality-of-service (QoS) at scale. Traditional
shortest-path and multicast routing algorithms are either computationally
prohibitive or structurally rigid, and they often fail to support heterogeneous
user demands, leading to suboptimal resource utilization. Neural network-based
approaches, while offering improved inference speed, typically lack topological
generalization and scalability. To address these limitations, this paper
presents a graph neural network (GNN)-based multicast routing framework that
jointly minimizes total transmission cost and supports user-specific video
quality requirements. The routing problem is formulated as a constrained
minimum-flow optimization task, and a reinforcement learning algorithm is
developed to sequentially construct efficient multicast trees by reusing paths
and adapting to network dynamics. A graph attention network (GAT) is employed
as the encoder to extract context-aware node embeddings, while a long
short-term memory (LSTM) module models the sequential dependencies in routing
decisions. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed method closely
approximates optimal dynamic programming-based solutions while significantly
reducing computational complexity. The results also confirm strong
generalization to large-scale and dynamic network topologies, highlighting the
method's potential for real-time deployment in 6G multimedia delivery
scenarios. Code is available at https://github.com/UNIC-Lab/GNN-Routing.

Abstract: The advent of the fifth-generation technology promises to bring about more
vertical applications and emerging services that include vehicular networks and
intelligent transportation systems (ITSs). To achieve their vision of real-time
and safetyapplications, vehicular networks rely on short-range to medium-range
communications. One emerging technology that aims to provide reliability and
high-data rate in short-range communications is the visible light
communications (VLC). Due to its remarkable advantages, some studies have
recently investigated the integration of VLC in vehicular networks and ITSs.
Despite their attractive features, such networks also face several
implementation issues. This paper provides an extended tutorial on the
implementation of VLC-based vehicular networks. To begin with, we present the
implementation characteristics of these systems and discuss some related
issues. The underlying system considers a general structure with transmitters,
channels, and receivers based on photodetectors and cameras, as well as
standardization efforts and types of topologies. In addition, we discuss the
impact of the sun and artificial light sources, flickering, dimming, throughput
enhancement, uplink security, and mobility on practical implementation.
Finally, we highlight some key challenges and potential solutions and provide
some directions for future research investigations that could constitute an
advancement toward the development of commercial VLC-based vehicular systems.

Abstract: This study investigates a cognitive shared access network with energy
harvesting capabilities operating under Age of Information (AoI) constraints
for the primary user. Secondary transmitters are spatially distributed
according to a homogeneous Poisson Point Process (PPP), while the primary user
is located at a fixed position. The primary transmitter handles bursty packet
arrivals, whereas secondary users operate under saturated traffic conditions.
To manage interference and energy, two distinct zones are introduced: an energy
harvesting zone around the primary transmitter and a guard zone around the
primary receiver, within which secondary transmissions are prohibited.
Secondary users access the channel probabilistically, with access decisions
depending on their current battery state (charged or empty) and their location
relative to the guard zone. Our objective is to analyze the primary user's AoI
performance under three distinct packet management policies.

Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) chatbots are now pervasive in digital ecosystems, yet
their network traffic remains largely underexplored. This study presents an
in-depth investigation of traffic generated by three leading chatbots (ChatGPT,
Copilot, and Gemini) when accessed via Android mobile apps for both text and
image generation. Using a dedicated capture architecture, we collect and label
two complementary workloads: a 60-hour generic dataset with unconstrained
prompts, and a controlled dataset built from identical prompts across GenAI
apps and replicated via conventional messaging apps to enable one-to-one
comparisons. This dual design allows us to address practical research questions
on the distinctiveness of GenAI traffic, its differences from widely deployed
traffic categories, and its novel implications for network usage. To this end,
we provide fine-grained traffic characterization at trace, flow, and protocol
levels, and model packet-sequence dynamics with Multimodal Markov Chains. Our
analyses reveal app- and content-specific traffic patterns, particularly in
volume, uplink/downlink profiles, and protocol adoption. We highlight the
predominance of TLS, with Gemini extensively leveraging QUIC, ChatGPT
exclusively using TLS 1.3, and app- and content-specific Server Name Indication
(SNI) values. A payload-based occlusion analysis quantifies SNI's contribution
to classification: masking it reduces F1-score by up to 20 percentage points in
GenAI app traffic classification. Finally, compared with conventional messaging
apps when carrying the same content, GenAI chatbots exhibit unique traffic
characteristics, highlighting new stress factors for mobile networks, such as
sustained upstream activity, with direct implications for network monitoring
and management. We publicly release the datasets to support reproducibility and
foster extensions to other use cases.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: This work presents a Network-Optimised Spiking (NOS) delay-aware scheduler
for 6G radio access. The scheme couples a bounded two-state kernel to a
clique-feasible proportional-fair (PF) grant head: the excitability state acts
as a finite-buffer proxy, the recovery state suppresses repeated grants, and
neighbour pressure is injected along the interference graph via delayed spikes.
A small-signal analysis yields a delay-dependent threshold $k_\star(\Delta)$
and a spectral margin $\delta = k_\star(\Delta) - gH\rho(W)$ that compress
topology, controller gain, and delay into a single design parameter. Under
light assumptions on arrivals, we prove geometric ergodicity for $\delta>0$ and
derive sub-Gaussian backlog and delay tail bounds with exponents proportional
to $\delta$. A numerical study, aligned with the analysis and a DU compute
budget, compares NOS with PF and delayed backpressure (BP) across interference
topologies over a $5$--$20$\,ms delay sweep. With a single gain fixed at the
worst spectral radius, NOS sustains higher utilisation and a smaller
99.9th-percentile delay while remaining clique-feasible on integer PRBs.

Abstract: Timely delivery of delay-sensitive information over dynamic, heterogeneous
networks is increasingly essential for a range of interactive applications,
such as industrial automation, self-driving vehicles, and augmented reality.
However, most existing network control solutions target only average delay
performance, falling short of providing strict End-to-End (E2E) peak latency
guarantees. This paper addresses the challenge of reliably delivering packets
within application-imposed deadlines by leveraging recent advancements in
Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MA-DRL). After introducing the
Delay-Constrained Maximum-Throughput (DCMT) dynamic network control problem,
and highlighting the limitations of current solutions, we present a novel
MA-DRL network control framework that leverages a centralized routing and
distributed scheduling architecture. The proposed framework leverages critical
networking domain knowledge for the design of effective MA-DRL strategies based
on the Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG) technique, where
centralized routing and distributed scheduling agents dynamically assign paths
and schedule packet transmissions according to packet lifetimes, thereby
maximizing on-time packet delivery. The generality of the proposed framework
allows integrating both data-driven \blue{Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)}
agents and traditional rule-based policies in order to strike the right balance
between performance and learning complexity. Our results confirm the
superiority of the proposed framework with respect to traditional stochastic
optimization-based approaches and provide key insights into the role and
interplay between data-driven DRL agents and new rule-based policies for both
efficient and high-performance control of latency-critical services.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Modern applications increasingly span across cloud, fog, and edge
environments, demanding orchestration systems that can adapt to diverse
deployment contexts while meeting Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements.
Standard Kubernetes schedulers do not account for user-defined objectives such
as energy efficiency, cost optimization, and global performance, often leaving
operators to make manual, cluster-by-cluster placement decisions. To address
this need, we present QONNECT, a vendor-agnostic orchestration framework that
enables declarative, QoS-driven application deployment across heterogeneous
Kubernetes and K3s clusters. QONNECT introduces a distributed architecture
composed of a central Knowledge Base, Raft-replicated Resource Lead Agents, and
lightweight Resource Agents in each cluster. Through a minimal YAML-based
interface, users specify high-level QoS goals, which the system translates into
concrete placement and migration actions. Our implementation is evaluated on a
federated testbed of up to nine cloud-fog-edge clusters using the Istio
Bookinfo microservice application. The system demonstrates dynamic,
policy-driven microservice placement, automated failover, QoS-compliant
rescheduling, and leader re-election after node failure, all without manual
intervention. By bridging the gap between declarative deployment models and
operational QoS goals, QONNECT transforms the cloud-edge continuum into a
unified, self-optimizing platform.

Abstract: Kubernetes multi-cluster deployments demand scalable and privacy-preserving
anomaly detection. Existing eBPF-based monitors provide low-overhead system and
network visibility but are limited to single clusters, while centralized
approaches incur bandwidth, privacy, and heterogeneity challenges. We propose
FedMon, a federated eBPF framework that unifies kernel-level telemetry with
federated learning (FL) for cross-cluster anomaly detection. Lightweight eBPF
agents capture syscalls and network events, extract local statistical and
sequence features, and share only model updates with a global server. A hybrid
detection engine combining Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) with Isolation
Forests enables both temporal pattern modeling and outlier detection. Deployed
across three Kubernetes clusters, FedMon achieves 94% precision, 91% recall,
and an F1-score of 0.92, while cutting bandwidth usage by 60% relative to
centralized baselines. Results demonstrate that FedMon enhances accuracy,
scalability, and privacy, providing an effective defense for large-scale,
multi-tenant cloud-native environments.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Edge computing allows for the decentralization of computing resources. This
decentralization is achieved through implementing microservice architectures,
which require low latencies to meet stringent service level agreements (SLA)
such as performance, reliability, and availability metrics. While cloud
computing offers the large data storage and computation resources necessary to
handle peak demands, a hybrid cloud and edge environment is required to ensure
SLA compliance. Several auto-scaling algorithms have been proposed to try to
achieve these compliance challenges, but they suffer from performance issues
and configuration complexity. This chapter provides a brief overview of edge
computing architecture, its uses, benefits, and challenges for resource
scaling. We then introduce Service Level Agreements, and existing research on
devising algorithms used in edge computing environments to meet these
agreements, along with their benefits and drawbacks.

Abstract: The Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture has been widely adopted in large
language models (LLMs) to reduce computation cost through model sparsity.
Employing speculative decoding (SD) can further accelerate MoE inference by
drafting multiple tokens per step and verifying them in parallel. However,
combining MoE with SD inflates GPU memory and aggravates CPU-GPU bandwidth
contention during multi-token verification. Existing MoE offloading systems are
SD-agnostic and do not address this bottleneck. We present SP-MoE, the first
SD-aware expert-offloading and compute-communication pipelining framework.
SP-MoE introduces: (1) speculative expert prefetching that exploits structural
correspondence between the draft and target models to prefetch likely experts
ahead of verification; (2) a cutoff-layer policy that bounds per-layer prefetch
depth based on empirical profiles and an analytical latency model, guaranteeing
just-in-time availability without overfetch; and (3) a pipelined runtime with
asynchronous prefetch threads and batched I/O to hide loading latency.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that SP-MoE achieves a 1.07-3.5 times TPOT
speedup over state-of-the-art methods across diverse datasets, environments,
and MoE-based models.

MMFL setting requires adapting to data and system heterogeneity across clients
as in single-model FL; these challenges are amplified in the MMFL setting due
to additional heterogeneity across models. Neither existing solutions nor
na\"ive extensions of single-model FL frameworks efficiently address these
challenges. To bridge this gap, we propose FLAMMABLE, a comprehensive MMFL
training framework. FLAMMABLE optimizes model training by intelligently
adapting client batch sizes while engaging them to train multiple carefully
chosen models, depending on their system capabilities, in each training round.
To evaluate FLAMMABLE, we develop the first benchmark platform for the MMFL
setting, which may enable future reproducible MMFL research. Extensive
evaluations on multiple datasets and models show that FLAMMABLE boosts the MMFL
time-to-accuracy performance by 1.1$\sim$10.0$\times$ while improving the final
model accuracy by 1.3$\sim$5.4\% compared to several known baselines.

Abstract: Context parallelism has emerged as a key technique to support long-context
training, a growing trend in generative AI for modern large models. However,
existing context parallel methods rely on static parallelization configurations
that overlook the dynamic nature of training data, specifically, the
variability in sequence lengths and token relationships (i.e., attention
patterns) across samples. As a result, these methods often suffer from
unnecessary communication overhead and imbalanced computation. In this paper,
we present DCP, a dynamic context parallel training framework that introduces
fine-grained blockwise partitioning of both data and computation. By enabling
flexible mapping of data and computation blocks to devices, DCP can adapt to
varying sequence characteristics, effectively reducing communication and
improving memory and computation balance. Micro-benchmarks demonstrate that DCP
accelerates attention by 1.19x~2.45x under causal masks and 2.15x~3.77x under
sparse attention patterns. Additionally, we observe up to 0.94x~1.16x
end-to-end training speed-up for causal masks, and 1.00x~1.46x for sparse
masks.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Research in compute resource management for cloud-native applications is
dominated by the problem of setting optimal CPU limits -- a fundamental OS
mechanism that strictly restricts a container's CPU usage to its specified
CPU-limits . Rightsizing and autoscaling works have innovated on
allocation/scaling policies assuming the ubiquity and necessity of CPU-limits .
We question this. Practical experiences of cloud users indicate that CPU-limits
harms application performance and costs more than it helps. These observations
are in contradiction to the conventional wisdom presented in both academic
research and industry best practices. We argue that this indiscriminate
adoption of CPU-limits is driven by erroneous beliefs that CPU-limits is
essential for operational and safety purposes. We provide empirical evidence
making a case for eschewing CPU-limits completely from latency-sensitive
applications. This prompts a fundamental rethinking of auto-scaling and billing
paradigms and opens new research avenues. Finally, we highlight specific
scenarios where CPU-limits can be beneficial if used in a well-reasoned way
(e.g. background jobs).

Abstract: We present the first spin-free, kernel-lock-free mutex that cooperates with
user-mode schedulers and is formally proven FIFO-fair and linearizable using
CSP/FDR. Our fairness oracle and stability-based proof method are reusable
across coroutine runtime designs. We designed the claim/release protocol for a
process-oriented language -- ProcessJ -- to manage the race for claiming shared
inter-process communication channels. Internally, we use a lock-free queue to
park waiting processes for gaining access to a shared object, such as exclusive
access to a shared channel to read from or write to. The queue ensures control
and fairness for processes wishing to access a shared resource, as the protocol
handles claim requests in the order they are inserted into the queue. We
produce CSP models of our protocol and a mutex specification, demonstrating
with FDR that our protocol behaves as a locking mutex.

Abstract: In this paper we represent a new framework for integrated distributed and

increase Satisfaction and Performance of this framework. At first we analyze
previous frameworks related to integrated systems, then represent new proposed
framework in order to improving previous framework, and we discuss its
different phases. Finally we compare the results of simulation of the new
framework with previous ones. In FIDRS framework, the technique of
heterogeneous distributed data base is used to improve Performance and speed in
responding to users and in this way we can improve dependability and
reliability of framework simultaneously. In extraction phase of the new
framework we have used RMSD algorithm that decreases responding time in big
database. Finally by using FDIRS framework we succeeded to increase Efficiency,
Performance and reliability of integrated systems and remove some of previous

Abstract: As microservice-based systems scale across the cloud-edge continuum,
traditional centralized scheduling mechanisms increasingly struggle with
latency, coordination overhead, and fault tolerance. This paper presents a new
architectural direction: leveraging service mesh sidecar proxies as
decentralized, in-situ schedulers to enable scalable, low-latency coordination
in large-scale, cloud-native environments. We propose embedding lightweight,
autonomous scheduling logic into each sidecar, allowing scheduling decisions to
be made locally without centralized control. This approach leverages the
growing maturity of service mesh infrastructures, which support programmable
distributed traffic management. We describe the design of such an architecture
and present initial results demonstrating its scalability potential in terms of
response time and latency under varying request rates. Rather than delivering a
finalized scheduling algorithm, this paper presents a system-level
architectural direction and preliminary evidence to support its scalability
potential.

Abstract: Large language models (LLM) are advanced AI systems trained on extensive
textual data, leveraging deep learning techniques to understand and generate
human-like language. Today's LLMs with billions of parameters are so huge that
hardly any single computing node can train, fine-tune, or infer from them.
Therefore, several distributed computing techniques are being introduced in the
literature to properly utilize LLMs. We have explored the application of
distributed computing techniques in LLMs from two angles.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item We study the techniques that democratize the LLM, that is, how large
models can be run on consumer-grade computers. Here, we also implement a novel
metaheuristics-based modification to an existing system.
  \item We perform a comparative study on three state-of-the-art LLM serving
techniques. \end{itemize}

Abstract: Discrete ordinates $S_N$ transport solvers on unstructured meshes pose a

a high-dimensional domain. In this paper, we review the performance bottlenecks
within the shared memory parallelization scheme of an existing transport solver

then survey the performance of this solver across a variety of compute
hardware. We then present a new Asynchronous Many-Task (AMT) algorithm for
shared memory parallelism, present results showing an increase in computational
performance over the existing method, and evaluate why performance is improved.

Abstract: We address the problem of computing a Minimum Weighted Vertex Cover (MWVC) in
a decentralized network. MWVC, a classical NP-hard problem, is foundational in
applications such as network monitoring and resource placement. We propose a
fully decentralized protocol where each node makes decisions using only local
knowledge and communicates with its neighbors. The method is adaptive,
communication-efficient, and avoids centralized coordination. We evaluate the
protocol on real-world and synthetic graphs, comparing it to both centralized
and decentralized baselines. Our results demonstrate competitive solution
quality with reduced communication overhead, highlighting the feasibility of
MWVC computation in decentralized environments.

Abstract: Functional verification is a critical bottleneck in integrated circuit
development, with CPU verification being especially time-intensive and
labour-consuming. Industrial practice relies on differential testing for CPU
verification, yet faces bottlenecks at nearly each stage of the framework
pipeline: front-end stimulus generation lacks micro-architectural awareness,
yielding low-quality and redundant tests that impede coverage closure and miss
corner cases. Meanwhile, back-end simulation infrastructure, even with FPGA
acceleration, often stalls on long-running tests and offers limited visibility,
delaying feedback and prolonging the debugging cycle. Here, we present ISAAC, a
full-stack, Large Language Model (LLM)-aided CPU verification framework with
FPGA parallelism, from bug categorisation and stimulus generation to simulation
infrastructure. To do so, we presented a multi-agent stimulus engine in ISAAC's
front-end, infused with micro-architectural knowledge and historical bug
patterns, generating highly targeted tests that rapidly achieve coverage goals
and capture elusive corner cases. In ISAAC's back-end, we introduce a
lightweight forward-snapshot mechanism and a decoupled co-simulation
architecture between the Instruction Set Simulator (ISS) and the Design Under
Test (DUT), enabling a single ISS to drive multiple DUTs in parallel. By
eliminating long-tail test bottlenecks and exploiting FPGA parallelism, the
simulation throughput is significantly improved. As a demonstration, we used
ISAAC to verify a mature CPU that has undergone multiple successful tape-outs.
Results show up to 17,536x speed-up over software RTL simulation, while
detecting several previously unknown bugs, two of which are reported in this
paper.

Abstract: Transformers are at the core of modern AI nowadays. They rely heavily on
matrix multiplication and require efficient acceleration due to their
substantial memory and computational requirements. Quantization plays a vital
role in reducing memory usage, and can be exploited for computations by
designing reconfigurable architectures that enhance matrix multiplication by
dynamically adjusting the precision. This paper proposes ADiP, a novel
adaptive-precision systolic array architecture designed for efficient matrix
multiplication acceleration.The proposed architecture consists of NxN
adaptive-precision processing elements (PEs) and shared accumulators. ADiP
supports multiple computation modes, including symmetric single-matrix
multiplication as well as asymmetric multi-matrix multiplication with a shared
input matrix, thereby improving data-reuse and PE utilization. In addition,
ADiP maximizes the computational density by adapting to different precisions,
such as 8bitx8bit, 8bitx4bit, and 8bitx2bit. Analytical models are developed
for ADiP architecture, including latency and throughput for versatile
architecture configurations. A comprehensive hardware design space exploration
is demonstrated using 22nm commercial technology, achieving up to a 4x higher
computational throughput. Furthermore, ADiP is evaluated on different
transformer workloads from GPT-2 Medium, BERT Large, and BitNet-1.58B models,
delivering latency improvement up to 53.6%, and energy improvement up to 24.4%
for BitNet-1.58B MHA workloads. At a 64x64 size with 4096 PEs, ADiP achieves a
peak throughput of 8.192 TOPS, 16.384 TOPS, and 32.768 TOPS for 8bitx8bit,
8bitx4bit, and 8bitx2bit operations, respectively.

resource-limited settings. The method investigates model deployment at
sub-octet precision levels (FP8, INT8, INT4, and FP4), with experimental
results indicating a 4.1x reduction in model size (FP4) and a 4.2x speedup in
inference speed, which correlates with an increased throughput of 66 tokens/s
(improvement by 4.8x). This underscores the importance of ultra-low precision
quantization for real-time deployment in IoT devices using FPGA accelerators,
achieving performance on par with expectations. Our evaluation covers
bidirectional translation between Indian and international languages,
showcasing its adaptability in low-resource linguistic contexts. The FPGA
deployment demonstrated a 1.96x reduction in LUTs and a 1.65x decrease in FFs,
resulting in a 2.2x enhancement in throughput compared to OPU and a 4.6x
enhancement compared to HPTA. Overall, the evaluation provides a viable
solution based on quantisation-aware translation along with hardware efficiency
suitable for deployable multilingual AI systems. The entire codes

Abstract: The rapid expansion of mass spectrometry (MS) data, now exceeding hundreds of
terabytes, poses significant challenges for efficient, large-scale library
search - a critical component for drug discovery. Traditional processors
struggle to handle this data volume efficiently, making in-storage computing
(ISP) a promising alternative. This work introduces an ISP architecture
leveraging a 3D Ferroelectric NAND (FeNAND) structure, providing significantly
higher density, faster speeds, and lower voltage requirements compared to
traditional NAND flash. Despite its superior density, the NAND structure has
not been widely utilized in ISP applications due to limited throughput
associated with row-by-row reads from serially connected cells. To overcome
these limitations, we integrate hyperdimensional computing (HDC), a
brain-inspired paradigm that enables highly parallel processing with simple
operations and strong error tolerance. By combining HDC with the proposed
dual-bound approximate matching (D-BAM) distance metric, tailored to the FeNAND
structure, we parallelize vector computations to enable efficient MS spectral
library search, achieving 43x speedup and 21x higher energy efficiency over
state-of-the-art 3D NAND methods, while maintaining comparable accuracy.

Abstract: Structured sparsity enables deploying large language models (LLMs) on
resource-constrained systems. Approaches like dense-to-sparse fine-tuning are
particularly compelling, achieving remarkable structured sparsity by reducing
the model size by over 6.7x, while still maintaining acceptable accuracy.
Despite this reduction, LLM inference, especially the decode stage being
inherently memory-bound, is extremely expensive on conventional Von-Neumann
architectures. Compute-in-memory (CIM) architectures mitigate this by
performing computations directly in memory, and when paired with sparse LLMs,
enable storing and computing the entire model in memory, eliminating the data
movement on the off-chip bus and improving efficiency. Nonetheless, naively
mapping sparse matrices onto CIM arrays leads to poor array utilization and
diminished computational efficiency. In this paper, we present an automated
framework with novel mapping and scheduling strategies to accelerate sparse LLM
inference on CIM accelerators. By exploiting block-diagonal sparsity, our
approach improves CIM array utilization by over 50%, achieving more than 4x
reduction in both memory footprint and the number of required floating-point
operations.
