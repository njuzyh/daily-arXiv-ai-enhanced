In this\npaper, we present DecodeX, a unified benchmarking framework for evaluating\nlow-density parity-check (LDPC) decoding acceleration across different hardware\nplatforms. DecodeX integrates a comprehensive suite of LDPC decoder\nimplementations, including kernels, APIs, and test vectors for CPUs (FlexRAN),\nGPUs (Aerial and Sionna-RK), and ASIC (ACC100), and can be readily extended to\nadditional architectures and configurations. Using DecodeX, we systematically\ncharacterize how different platforms orchestrate computation-from threading and\nmemory management to data movement and accelerator offload-and quantify the\nresulting decoding latency under varying Physical layer parameters. Our\nobservations reveal distinct trade-offs in parallel efficiency and offload\noverhead, showing that accelerator gains strongly depend on data-movement and\nworkload granularity. Building on these insights, we discuss how cross-platform\nbenchmarking can inform adaptive scheduling and co-design for future\nheterogeneous vRANs, enabling scalable and energy-efficient baseband processing\nfor NextG wireless systems."}
