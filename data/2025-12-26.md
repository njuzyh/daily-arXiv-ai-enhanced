Abstract: LLMs have shown early promise in generating RTL code, yet evaluating their capabilities in realistic setups remains a challenge. So far, RTL benchmarks have been limited in scale, skewed toward trivial designs, offering minimal verification rigor, and remaining vulnerable to data contamination. To overcome these limitations and to push the field forward, this paper introduces NotSoTiny, a benchmark that assesses LLM on the generation of structurally rich and context-aware RTL. Built from hundreds of actual hardware designs produced by the Tiny Tapeout community, our automated pipeline removes duplicates, verifies correctness and periodically incorporates new designs to mitigate contamination, matching Tiny Tapeout release schedule. Evaluation results show that NotSoTiny tasks are more challenging than prior benchmarks, emphasizing its effectiveness in overcoming current limitations of LLMs applied to hardware design, and in guiding the improvement of such promising technology.

Abstract: In this paper, we present ElfCore, a 28nm digital spiking neural network processor tailored for event-driven sensory signal processing. ElfCore is the first to efficiently integrate: (1) a local online self-supervised learning engine that enables multi-layer temporal learning without labeled inputs; (2) a dynamic structured sparse training engine that supports high-accuracy sparse-to-sparse learning; and (3) an activity-dependent sparse weight update mechanism that selectively updates weights based solely on input activity and network dynamics. Demonstrated on tasks including gesture recognition, speech, and biomedical signal processing, ElfCore outperforms state-of-the-art solutions with up to 16X lower power consumption, 3.8X reduced on-chip memory requirements, and 5.9X greater network capacity efficiency.

Abstract: Hybrid AI-HPC workflows combine large-scale simulation, training, high-throughput inference, and tightly coupled, agent-driven control within a single execution campaign. These workflows impose heterogeneous and often conflicting requirements on runtime systems, spanning MPI executables, persistent AI services, fine-grained tasks, and low-latency AI-HPC coupling. Existing systems typically address only subsets of these requirements, limiting their ability to support emerging AI-HPC applications at scale. We present RHAPSODY, a multi-runtime middleware that enables concurrent execution of heterogeneous AI-HPC workloads through uniform abstractions for tasks, services, resources, and execution policies. Rather than replacing existing runtimes, RHAPSODY composes and coordinates them, allowing simulation codes, inference services, and agentic workflows to coexist within a single job allocation on leadership-class HPC platforms. We evaluate RHAPSODY with Dragon and vLLM on multiple HPC systems using representative heterogeneous, inference-at-scale, and tightly coupled AI-HPC workflows. Our results show that RHAPSODY introduces minimal runtime overhead, sustains increasing heterogeneity at scale, achieves near-linear scaling for high-throughput inference workloads, and data- and control-efficient coupling between AI and HPC tasks in agentic workflows.

Abstract: Extending well-structured transition systems to incorporate a probabilistic scheduling rule, we define a new class of stochastic well-structured transition systems that includes population protocols, chemical reaction networks, and many common gossip models; as well as augmentations of these systems by an oracle that exposes a total order on agents as in population protocols in the comparison model or an equivalence relation as in population protocols with unordered data.
  We show that any implementation of a phase clock in these systems either stops or ticks too fast after polynomially many expected steps, and that any terminating computation in these systems finishes or fails in expected polynomial time. This latter property allows an exact characterization of the computational power of many stochastic well-structured transition systems augmented with a total order or equivalence relation on agents, showing that these compute exactly the languages in BPP, while the corresponding unaugmented systems compute just the symmetric languages in BPL.

Abstract: The rapid growth of large language models (LLMs) and the continuous release of new GPU products have significantly increased the demand for distributed training across heterogeneous GPU environments. In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of the challenges involved in implementing 3D parallelism in such environments, addressing critical issues such as the need for symmetric tensor parallelism, efficient gradient synchronization in asymmetric pipeline parallelism, and the trade-offs between memory utilization and computational efficiency. Building upon these insights, we introduce AutoHet, a novel system that automatically identifies the optimal parallelism plan for distributed training on heterogeneous GPUs. AutoHet supports asymmetric 3D parallelism structures and facilitates fine-grained workload distribution. We propose a theoretical model that frames the device grouping and load balancing as an optimization problem to minimize per-iteration training time, thus effectively balancing computing power and memory usage across GPUs with diverse capabilities. To enable elastic training upon spot instance preemption, AutoHet presents an efficient recovery strategy that prioritizes to retrieve training states from local nodes, and only downloads the missing checkpoints from the cloud storage. Our extensive evaluation, conducted on three large-scale models and utilizing combinations of three different GPU types, demonstrates that AutoHet outperforms existing DNN training systems, achieving up to a 1.79$\times$ speedup in training throughput compared with Megatron-LM and Whale, and a 4.38$\times$ speedup of recovery speed compared to a spot instance baseline.

Abstract: As foundation models grow in size, fine-tuning them becomes increasingly expensive. While GPU spot instances offer a low-cost alternative to on-demand resources, their volatile prices and availability make deadline-aware scheduling particularly challenging. We tackle this difficulty by using a mix of spot and on-demand instances. Distinctively, we show the predictability of prices and availability in a spot instance market, the power of prediction in enabling cost-efficient scheduling and its sensitivity to estimation errors. An integer programming problem is formulated to capture the use of mixed instances under both the price and availability dynamics. We propose an online allocation algorithm with prediction based on the committed horizon control approach that leverages a \emph{commitment level} to enforce the partial sequence of decisions. When this prediction becomes inaccurate, we further present a complementary online algorithm without predictions. An online policy selection algorithm is developed that learns the best policy from a pool constructed by varying the parameters of both algorithms. We prove that the prediction-based algorithm achieves tighter performance bounds as prediction error decreases, while the policy selection algorithm possesses a regret bound of $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T})$. Experimental results demonstrate that our online framework can adaptively select the best policy under varying spot market dynamics and prediction quality, consistently outperforming baselines and improving utility by up to 54.8\%.

Abstract: Distributed attention is a fundamental problem for scaling context window for Large Language Models (LLMs). The state-of-the-art method, Ring-Attention, suffers from scalability limitations due to its excessive communication traffic. This paper proposes a new distributed attention algorithm, Mesh-Attention, by rethinking the design space of distributed attention with a new matrix-based model. Our method assigns a two-dimensional tile -- rather than one-dimensional row or column -- of computation blocks to each GPU to achieve higher efficiency through lower communication-computation (CommCom) ratio. The general approach covers Ring-Attention as a special case, and allows the tuning of CommCom ratio with different tile shapes. Importantly, we propose a greedy algorithm that can efficiently search the scheduling space within the tile with restrictions that ensure efficient communication among GPUs. The theoretical analysis shows that Mesh-Attention leads to a much lower communication complexity and exhibits good scalability comparing to other current algorithms.
  Our extensive experiment results show that Mesh-Attention can achieve up to 3.4x speedup (2.9x on average) and reduce the communication volume by up to 85.4% (79.0% on average) on 256 GPUs. Our scalability results further demonstrate that Mesh-Attention sustains superior performance as the system scales, substantially reducing overhead in large-scale deployments. The results convincingly confirm the advantage of Mesh-Attention.

Abstract: Higher-order interactions beyond pairwise relationships in large complex networks are often modeled as hypergraphs. Analyzing hypergraph properties such as triad counts is essential, as hypergraphs can reveal intricate group interaction patterns that conventional graphs fail to capture. In real-world scenarios, these networks are often large and dynamic, introducing significant computational challenges. Due to the absence of specialized software packages and data structures, the analysis of large dynamic hypergraphs remains largely unexplored. Motivated by this gap, we propose ESCHER, a GPU-centric parallel data structure for Efficient and Scalable Hypergraph Evolution Representation, designed to manage large scale hypergraph dynamics efficiently. We also design a hypergraph triad-count update framework that minimizes redundant computation while fully leveraging the capabilities of ESCHER for dynamic operations. We validate the efficacy of our approach across multiple categories of hypergraph triad counting, including hyperedge-based, incident-vertex-based, and temporal triads. Empirical results on both large real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving speedups of up to 104.5x, 473.7x, and 112.5x for hyperedge-based, incident-vertex-based, and temporal triad types, respectively.

Abstract: Privacy concerns around 5G, the latest generation of mobile networks, are growing, with fears that its deployment may increase exposure to privacy risks. This perception is largely driven by the use of denser deployments of small antenna systems, which enable highly accurate data collection at higher speeds and closer proximity to mobile users. At the same time, 5G's unique radio communication features can make the reproduction of known network attacks more challenging. In particular, passive network attacks, which do not involve direct interaction with the target network and are therefore nearly impossible to detect, remain a pressing concern. Such attacks can reveal sensitive information about users, their devices, and active applications, which may then be exploited through known vulnerabilities or spear-phishing schemes. This survey examines the feasibility of passive network attacks in 5G and beyond (B5G/6G) networks, with emphasis on two major categories: information extraction (system identification, website and application fingerprinting) and geolocation (user identification and position tracking). These attacks are well documented and reproducible in existing wireless and mobile systems, including short-range networks (IEEE 802.11) and, to a lesser extent, LTE. Current evidence suggests that while such attacks remain theoretically possible in 5G, their practical execution is significantly constrained by directional beamforming, high-frequency propagation characteristics, and encryption mechanisms. For B5G and early 6G networks, the lack of public tools and high hardware cost currently renders these attacks infeasible in practice, which highlights a critical gap in our understanding of future network threat models.

Abstract: Intent-Based Networking (IBN) offers a promising paradigm for intelligent and automated network control in Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) environments by translating high-level user intents into executable network strategies. However, frequent strategy deployment and rollback are impractical in real-world IIoT systems due to tightly coupled workflows and high downtime costs, while the heterogeneity and privacy constraints of IIoT nodes further complicate centralized policy verification. To address these challenges, we propose FEIBN, a Federated Evaluation Enhanced Intent-Based Networking framework. FEIBN leverages large language models (LLMs) to align multimodal user intents into structured strategy tuples and employs federated learning to perform distributed policy verification across IIoT nodes without exposing raw data. To improve training efficiency and reduce communication overhead, we design SSAFL, a Strategy Similarity Aware Federated Learning mechanism that selects task-relevant nodes based on strategy similarity and resource status, and triggers asynchronous model uploads only when updates are significant. Experiments demonstrate that SSAFL can improve model accuracy, accelerate model convergence, and reduce the cost by 27.8% compared with SemiAsyn.

Abstract: Network traffic classification, particularly elephant flow detection, faces significant challenges when deployed across heterogeneous network environments. While existing approaches demonstrate high accuracy within single domains, they suffer from poor generalization due to domain shift phenomena. This paper presents a unified machine learning framework for cross domain elephant flow detection that incorporates application aware and security features to enhance robustness across diverse network environments. Our approach addresses the critical gap in existing literature by evaluating model performance across three distinct domains: Campus networks, UNSW-NB15, and CIC-IDS2018 datasets. This paper proposes a unified pipeline that employs adaptive thresholding, comprehensive feature engineering, and cross-domain evaluation to quantify and mitigate domain shift effects. Experimental results demonstrate significant performance variations across domains (F1-scores ranging from 0.37 to 0.97), highlighting the importance of cross-domain validation. The unified model achieves an overall cross-validation F1 score of 0.99 while maintaining interpretability through feature importance analysis. Our findings reveal that while size based features dominate elephant flow detection (33.80% importance for total bytes), application-aware and security features contribute to improved classification accuracy and provide valuable insights for network management and security applications.

Abstract: In the era of digital transformation, the global deployment of internet of things (IoT) networks and wireless sensor networks (WSNs) is critical for applications ranging from environmental monitoring to smart cities. Large-scale monitoring using WSNs incurs high costs due to the deployment of sensor nodes in the target deployment area. In this paper, we address the challenge of prohibitive deployment costs by proposing an integrated mixed-Integer linear programming (MILP) framework that strategically combines static and mobile Zigbee nodes. Our network planning approach introduces three novel formulations, including boundary-optimized static node placement (MILP-Static), mobile path planning for coverage maximization (MILP-Cov), and movement minimization (MILP-Mov) of the mobile nodes. We validated our framework with extensive simulations and experimental measurements of Zigbee power constraints. Our results show that boundary-optimized static placement (MILP-Static) achieves 53.06% coverage compared with 33.42% of the random approach. In addition, MILP-Cov for path planning reaches 97.95% coverage, while movement minimization (MILP-Mov) reduces traversal cost by 40%. Our proposed framework outperforms the benchmark approaches to provide a foundational solution for cost-effective global IoT deployment in resource constrained environments.

Abstract: The escalating complexity of sixth-generation (6G) networks demands unprecedented levels of autonomy beyond the capabilities of traditional optimization-based and current AI-based resource management approaches. While agentic AI has emerged as a promising paradigm for autonomous RAN, current frameworks provide sophisticated reasoning capabilities but lack mechanisms for empirical validation and self-improvement. This article identifies simulation-in-the-loop validation as a critical enabler for truly autonomous networks, where AI agents can empirically verify decisions and learn from outcomes. We present the first reflection-driven self-optimization framework that integrates agentic AI with high-fidelity network simulation in a closed-loop architecture. Our system orchestrates four specialized agents, including scenario, solver, simulation, and reflector agents, working in concert to transform agentic AI into a self-correcting system capable of escaping local optima, recognizing implicit user intent, and adapting to dynamic network conditions. Extensive experiments validate significant performance improvements over non-agentic approaches: 17.1\% higher throughput in interference optimization, 67\% improved user QoS satisfaction through intent recognition, and 25\% reduced resource utilization during low-traffic periods while maintaining service quality.

Abstract: The 6G wireless aims at the Tb/s peak data rates are expected, a sub-millisecond latency, massive Internet of Things/vehicle connectivity, which requires sustainable access to audio over the air and energy-saving functionality. Cognitive Radio Networks CCNs help in alleviating the problem of spectrum scarcity, but classical sensing and allocation are still energy-consumption intensive, and sensitive to rapid spectrum variations. Our framework which centers on AI driven green CRN aims at integrating deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with transfer learning, energy harvesting (EH), reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) with other light-weight genetic refinement operations that optimally combine sensing timelines, transmit power, bandwidth distribution and RIS phase selection. Compared to two baselines, the utilization of MATLAB + NS-3 under dense loads, a traditional CRN with energy sensing under fixed policies, and a hybrid CRN with cooperative sensing under heuristic distribution of resource, there are (25-30%) fewer energy reserves used, sensing AUC greater than 0.90 and +6-13 p.p. higher PDR. The integrated framework is easily scalable to large IoT and vehicular applications, and it provides a feasible and sustainable roadmap to 6G CRNs.

Abstract: Due to their inherent flexibility and autonomous operation, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been widely used in Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) to provide real-time biomedical edge computing service for wireless body area network (WBAN) users. In this paper, considering the time-varying task criticality characteristics of diverse WBAN users and the dual mobility between WBAN users and UAV, we investigate the dynamic task offloading and UAV flight trajectory optimization problem to minimize the weighted average task completion time of all the WBAN users, under the constraint of UAV energy consumption. To tackle the problem, an embodied AI-enhanced IoMT edge computing framework is established. Specifically, we propose a novel hierarchical multi-scale Transformer-based user trajectory prediction model based on the users' historical trajectory traces captured by the embodied AI agent (i.e., UAV). Afterwards, a prediction-enhanced deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm that integrates predicted users' mobility information is designed for intelligently optimizing UAV flight trajectory and task offloading decisions. Real-word movement traces and simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed methods in comparison with the existing benchmarks.

Abstract: To support on-device inference, the next-generation mobile networks are expected to support real-time model downloading services to mobile users. However, powerful AI models typically have large model sizes, resulting in excessive end-to-end (E2E) downloading-and-inference (DAI) latency. To address this issue, we propose a simultaneous model downloading and inference (SLIDE) framework, which allows users to perform inference with downloaded layers while simultaneously receiving the remaining layers of the model. To this end, we formulate a task throughput maximization problem by jointly optimizing model provisioning, spectrum bandwidth allocation, and computing resource allocation for multi-user downlink systems. Unlike traditional DAI frameworks, SLIDE introduces recursive dependencies across layers, where inference latency depends recursively on the downloading bandwidth and computing resource allocation for each of the preceding layers. To solve this challenging problem, we design an efficient algorithm that acquires the optimal solution with polynomial-time complexity. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed SLIDE framework significantly improves task throughput under latency and communication resource constraints compared with the conventional model downloading schemes.

Abstract: The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) requires networks that deliver ultra-low latency, high reliability, and cost efficiency, which traditional optimization methods and deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based approaches struggle to provide under dynamic and heterogeneous workloads. To address this gap, large language model (LLM)-empowered agentic AI has emerged as a promising paradigm, integrating reasoning, planning, and adaptation to enable QoE-aware network management. In this paper, we explore the integration of agentic AI into QoE-aware network slicing for IIoT. We first review the network slicing management architecture, QoE metrics for IIoT applications, and the challenges of dynamically managing heterogeneous network slices, while highlighting the motivations and advantages of adopting agentic AI. We then present the workflow of agentic AI-based slicing management, illustrating the full lifecycle of AI agents from processing slice requests to constructing slice instances and performing dynamic adjustments. Furthermore, we propose an LLM-empowered agentic AI approach for slicing management, which integrates a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) module for semantic intent inference, a DRL-based orchestrator for slicing configuration, and an incremental memory mechanism for continual learning and adaptation. Through a case study on heterogeneous slice management, we demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms other baselines in balancing latency, reliability, and cost, and achieves up to a 19% improvement in slice availability ratio.

Abstract: Traffic classification on programmable data plane holds great promise for line-rate processing, with methods evolving from per-packet to flow-level analysis for higher accuracy. However, a trade-off between accuracy and efficiency persists. Statistical feature-based methods align with hardware constraints but often exhibit limited accuracy, while online deep learning methods using packet sequential features achieve superior accuracy but require substantial computational resources. This paper presents Synecdoche, the first traffic classification framework that successfully deploys packet sequential features on a programmable data plane via pattern matching, achieving both high accuracy and efficiency. Our key insight is that discriminative information concentrates in short sub-sequences--termed Key Segments--that serve as compact traffic features for efficient data plane matching. Synecdoche employs an "offline discovery, online matching" paradigm: deep learning models automatically discover Key Segment patterns offline, which are then compiled into optimized table entries for direct data plane matching. Extensive experiments demonstrate Synecdoche's superior accuracy, improving F1-scores by up to 26.4% against statistical methods and 18.3% against online deep learning methods, while reducing latency by 13.0% and achieving 79.2% reduction in SRAM usage. The source code of Synecdoche is publicly available to facilitate reproducibility and further research.

Abstract: The proliferation of Internet-of-things (IoT) infrastructures and the widespread adoption of traffic encryption present significant challenges, particularly in environments characterized by dynamic traffic patterns, constrained computational capabilities, and strict latency constraints. In this paper, we propose DMLITE, a diffusion model and large language model (LLM) integrated traffic embedding framework for network traffic detection within resource-limited IoT environments. The DMLITE overcomes these challenges through a tri-phase architecture including traffic visual preprocessing, diffusion-based multi-level feature extraction, and LLM-guided feature optimization. Specifically, the framework utilizes self-supervised diffusion models to capture both fine-grained and abstract patterns in encrypted traffic through multi-level feature fusion and contrastive learning with representative sample selection, thus enabling rapid adaptation to new traffic patterns with minimal labeled data. Furthermore, DMLITE incorporates LLMs to dynamically adjust particle swarm optimization parameters for intelligent feature selection by implementing a dual objective function that minimizes both classification error and variance across data distributions. Comprehensive experimental validation on benchmark datasets confirms the effectiveness of DMLITE, achieving classification accuracies of 98.87\%, 92.61\%, and 99.83\% on USTC-TFC, ISCX-VPN, and Edge-IIoTset datasets, respectively. This improves classification accuracy by an average of 3.7\% and reduces training time by an average of 41.9\% compared to the representative deep learning model.
