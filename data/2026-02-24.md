Abstract: Cell-free massive MIMO (CFmMIMO) systems require scalable and reliable distributed coordination mechanisms to operate under stringent communication and latency constraints. A central challenge is the Access Point Selection (APS) problem, which seeks to determine the subset of serving Access Points (APs) for each User Equipment (UE) that can satisfy UEs' Spectral Efficiency (SE) requirements while minimizing network power consumption. We introduce APS-GNN, a scalable distributed multi-agent learning framework that decomposes APS into agents operating at the granularity of individual AP-UE connections. Agents coordinate via local observation exchange over a novel Graph Neural Network (GNN) architecture and share parameters to reuse their knowledge and experience. APS-GNN adopts a constrained reinforcement learning approach to provide agents with explicit observability of APS' conflicting objectives, treating SE satisfaction as a cost and power reduction as a reward. Both signals are defined locally, facilitating effective credit assignment and scalable coordination in large networks. To further improve training stability and exploration efficiency, the policy is initialized via supervised imitation learning from a heuristic APS baseline. We develop a realistic CFmMIMO simulator and demonstrate that APS-GNN delivers the target SE while activating 50-70% fewer APs than heuristic and centralized Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) baselines in different evaluation scenarios. Moreover, APS-GNN achieves one to two orders of magnitude lower inference latency than centralized MARL approaches due to its fully parallel and distributed execution. These results establish APS-GNN as a practical and scalable solution for APS in large-scale CFmMIMO networks.

Abstract: Hardware heterogeneity across diverse user devices poses new challenges for beam-based communication in 5G and beyond. This heterogeneity limits the applicability of machine learning (ML)-based algorithms. This article highlights the critical need to treat hardware heterogeneity as a first-class design concern in ML-aided beam management. We analyze key failure modes in the presence of heterogeneity and present case studies demonstrating their performance impact. Finally, we discuss potential strategies to improve generalization in beam management.

Abstract: Visible Light Communication (VLC) using Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) has gained attention due to its low power consumption, long lifetime, and fast response. However, VLC suffers from optical noise generated by ambient light sources such as fluorescent lamps, which leads to waveform distortion and increased bit error rates (BER). In this paper, we propose two noise reduction methods for Digital Visible Light Communication (DVLC) systems. The first method exploits the periodic nature of interference caused by AC-powered-line illumination and reduces interference by subtracting sampled noise waveforms from the received signal. Second, inspired by Active Noise Control (ANC) techniques, an additional photodiode is introduced for noise reception, and subtraction circuits are employed to attenuate noise in real time. Experimental results show that both methods improve BER performance compared with conventional receivers, with the ANC-inspired approach achieving superior performance under all tested conditions.

Abstract: Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs) support the information dissemination among vehicles, Roadside Units (RSUs), and a Trust Authority (TA). A trust model evaluates an entity or data or both to determine truthfulness. A security model confirms authentication, integrity, availability, non repudiation issues. With these aspects in mind, many models have been proposed in literature. Furthermore, many information dissemination approaches are proposed. However, the lack of a model that can manage traffic incidents completely inspires this work. This paper details how and when a message needs to be generated and relayed so that the incidents can be reported and managed in a timely manner. This paper addresses this challenge by providing a traffic incident management model to manage several traffic incidents efficiently. Additionally, we simulate this model using the VEINS simulator with vehicles, RSUs, and a TA. From the experiments, we measure the average number of transmissions required for reporting a single traffic incident while varying the vehicle density and relaying considerations. We consider two types of relaying. In one series of experiments, messages from regular vehicles and RSUs are relayed up to four hops. In another series of experiments, messages from the regular vehicles and RSUs are relayed until their generation time reaches sixty seconds. Additionally, messages from the official vehicles are relayed when they approach an incident or when the incident is cleared. Results from the simulations show that more vehicles are informed with four-hop relaying than sixty-second relaying in both cases.

Abstract: In this work, we present HiAER-Spike, a modular, reconfigurable, event-driven neuromorphic computing platform designed to execute large spiking neural networks with up to 160 million neurons and 40 billion synapses - roughly twice the neurons of a mouse brain at faster than real time. This system, assembled at the UC San Diego Supercomputer Center, comprises a co-designed hard- and software stack that is optimized for run-time massively parallel processing and hierarchical address-event routing (HiAER) of spikes while promoting memory-efficient network storage and execution. The architecture efficiently handles both sparse connectivity and sparse activity for robust and low-latency event-driven inference for both edge and cloud computing. A Python programming interface to HiAER-Spike, agnostic to hardware-level detail, shields the user from complexity in the configuration and execution of general spiking neural networks with minimal constraints in topology. The system is made easily available over a web portal for use by the wider community. In the following, we provide an overview of the hard- and software stack, explain the underlying design principles, demonstrate some of the system's capabilities and solicit feedback from the broader neuromorphic community. Examples are shown demonstrating HiAER-Spike's capabilities for event-driven vision on benchmark CIFAR-10, DVS event-based gesture, MNIST, and Pong tasks.

Abstract: Neuromorphic accelerators promise unparalleled energy efficiency and computational density for spiking neural networks (SNNs), especially in edge intelligence applications. However, most existing platforms exhibit rigid architectures with limited configurability, restricting their adaptability to heterogeneous workloads and diverse design objectives. To address these limitations, we present Flexi-NeurA -- a parameterizable neuromorphic accelerator (core) that unifies configurability, flexibility, and efficiency. Flexi-NeurA allows users to customize neuron models, network structures, and precision settings at design time. By pairing these design-time configurability and flexibility features with a time-multiplexed and event-driven processing approach, Flexi-NeurA substantially reduces the required hardware resources and total power while preserving high efficiency and low inference latency. Complementing this, we introduce Flex-plorer, a heuristic-guided design-space exploration (DSE) tool that determines cost-effective fixed-point precisions for critical parameters -- such as decay factors, synaptic weights, and membrane potentials -- based on user-defined trade-offs between accuracy and resource usage. Based on the configuration selected through the Flex-plorer process, RTL code is configured to match the specified design. Comprehensive evaluations across MNIST, SHD, and DVS benchmarks demonstrate that the Flexi-NeurA and Flex-plorer co-framework achieves substantial improvements in accuracy, latency, and energy efficiency. A three-layer 256--128--10 fully connected network with LIF neurons mapped onto two processing cores achieves 97.23% accuracy on MNIST with 1.1~ms inference latency, utilizing only 1,623 logic cells, 7 BRAMs, and 111~mW of total power -- establishing Flexi-NeurA as a scalable, edge-ready neuromorphic platform.

Abstract: Reproducible container builds promise a simple integrity check for software supply chains: rebuild an image from its Dockerfile and compare hashes. We build a Docker measurement pipeline and apply it to a stratified sample of 2,000 GitHub repositories that contained a Dockerfile. We found that only 56% produce any buildable image, and just 2.7% of those are bitwise reproducible without any infrastructure configurations. After modifying infrastructure configurations, we raise bitwise reproducibility by 18.6%, but 78.7% of buildable Dockerfiles remain non-reproducible. We analyze the root causes of the remaining differences, and find that beyond timestamps and metadata, developer-controlled choices such as uncleaned caches, logs, documentation, and floating versions are dominant causes of non-reproducibility. We derive concrete Dockerfile guidelines from these patterns and discuss how they can inform future linters and Continuous Integration (CI) checks for reproducible containers.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive characterization study of open-source message-oriented middleware (MOM) systems. We followed a rigorous methodology to select and study ten popular and diverse MOM systems. For each system, we examine 42 features with a total of 134 different options. We found that MOM systems have evolved to provide a framework for modern cloud applications through high flexibility and configurability and by offering core building blocks for complex applications including transaction support, active messaging, resource management, flow control, and native support for multi-tenancy. We also identify that there is an opportunity for the community to consolidate its efforts on fewer open-source projects.
  We have also created an annotated data set that makes it easy to verify our findings, which can also be used to help practitioners and developers understand and compare the features of different systems. For a wider impact, we make our data set publicly available.

Abstract: IoT applications are increasingly relying on on-device AI accelerators to ensure high performance, especially in limited connectivity and safety-critical scenarios. However, the limited on-chip memory of these accelerators forces inference runtimes to swap model segments between host and accelerator memory, substantially inflating latency. While collaborative processing by partitioning the model processing between CPU and accelerator resources can reduce accelerator memory pressure and latency, naive partitioning may worsen end-to-end latency by either shifting excessive computation to the CPU or failing to sufficiently curb swapping, a problem that is further amplified in multi-tenant and dynamic environments.
  To address these issues, we present SwapLess, a system for adaptive, multi-tenant TPU-CPU collaborative inference for memory-constrained Edge TPUs. SwapLess utilizes an analytic queueing model that captures partition-dependent CPU/TPU service times as well as inter- and intra-model swapping overheads across different workload mixes and request rates. Using this model, SwapLess continuously adjusts both the partition point and CPU core allocation online to minimize end-to-end response time with low decision overhead. An implementation on Edge TPU-equipped platforms demonstrates that SwapLess reduces mean latency by up to 63.8% for single-tenant workloads and up to 77.4% for multi-tenant workloads relative to the default Edge TPU compiler.

Abstract: A low out-degree orientation directs each edge of an undirected graph with the goal of minimizing the maximum out-degree of a vertex. In the parallel batch-dynamic setting, one can insert or delete batches of edges, and the goal is to process the entire batch in parallel with work per edge similar to that of a single sequential update and with span (or depth) for the entire batch that is polylogarithmic. In this paper we present faster parallel batch-dynamic algorithms for maintaining a low out-degree orientation of an undirected graph. All results herein achieve polylogarithmic depth, with high probability (whp); the focus of this paper is on minimizing the work, which varies across results.
  Our first result is the first parallel batch-dynamic algorithm to maintain an asymptotically optimal orientation with asymptotically optimal expected work bounds, in an amortized sense, improving over the prior best work bounds of Liu et al.~[SPAA~'22] by a logarithmic factor.
  Our second result is a $O(c \log n)$ orientation algorithm with expected worst-case $O(\sqrt{\log n})$ work per edge update, where $c$ is a known upper-bound on the arboricity of the graph. This matches the best-known sequential worst-case $O(c \log n)$ orientation algorithm given by Berglin and Brodal ~[Algorithmica~'18], albeit in expectation.
  Our final result is a $O(c + \log n)$-orientation algorithm with $O(\log^2 n)$ expected worst-case work per edge update. This algorithm significantly improves upon the recent result of Ghaffari and Koo~[SPAA~'25], which maintains a $O(c)$-orientation with $O(\log^9 n)$ worst-case work per edge whp.

Abstract: Collocating deep learning training tasks improves GPU utilization but causes drastic slowdowns due to resource contention and risks Out-of-Memory (OOM) failures. Accurate memory estimation is essential for robust collocation, while GPU utilization -- a key proxy for resource contention -- enables interference-aware scheduling to reduce slowdowns and improve throughput. Existing GPU memory estimators span three paradigms -- analytical models, CPU-side libraries, and ML-based estimators -- each with distinct limitations: dependence on detailed model specifications, intrusive integration, poor generalization, and varying latency overhead. GPU heterogeneity further complicates estimation, as identical tasks can exhibit markedly different memory footprints across hardware generations. GPU utilization remains comparatively understudied, further complicated by the non-additive nature of utilization metrics and hardware sensitivity. We conduct a systematic analysis of representative estimators from each paradigm -- Horus, PyTorch FakeTensor, and our lightweight ML-based estimator -- evaluating accuracy, generalizability, and practical overhead. We construct a synthetic dataset spanning MLPs, CNNs, and Transformers with controlled architectural variations, and train MLP- and Transformer-based estimators for memory prediction. We further experiment with utilization estimation on the same dataset. Our evaluation reveals key tradeoffs and validates estimators against real-world unseen models. Significant challenges remain: analytical models are hardware-dependent, CPU-side libraries impose intrusive integration costs, and ML-based estimators struggle with cross-architecture generalization. We release all datasets, tools, and artifacts to support further research.

Abstract: In the last decade, subgraph detection and enumeration have emerged as a central problem in distributed graph algorithms. This is largely due to the theoretical challenges and practical applications of these problems. In this paper, we initiate the systematic study of distributed sub-hypergraph enumeration in hypergraphs. To this end, we (1)~introduce several computational models for hypergraphs that generalize the CONGEST model for graphs and evaluate their relative computational power, (2)~devise algorithms for distributed triangle enumeration in our computational models and prove their optimality in two such models, (3)~introduce classes of sparse and ``everywhere sparse'' hypergraphs and describe efficient distributed algorithms for triangle enumeration in these classes, and (4)~describe general techniques that we believe to be useful for designing efficient algorithms in our hypergraph models.

Abstract: As large language models continue to scale, training demands on compute and system capacity grow rapidly, making single-vendor homogeneous clusters insufficient. This paper presents a technical solution for heterogeneous mixed training in AMD-NVIDIA environments. We first adopt a compatibility-oriented approach based on CPU-Forwarding Communication, with differentiated communication back-end selection across parallel groups and multi-NIC parallel data transfer. To achieve higher performance, we further propose another Device-Direct Communication approach, integrating a CPU-offloading P2P mechanism to enable direct cross-vendor GPU data transfer without host-memory staging. Experiments on LLaMA-8B and Qwen2-7B demonstrate that the proposed Device-Direct Communication approach achieves up to 98% of the throughput of an NVIDIA homogeneous system, while preserving training stability and correctness.

Abstract: A growing number of critical workflow applications leverage a streamlined edge-hub-cloud architecture, which diverges from the conventional edge computing paradigm. An edge device, in collaboration with a hub device and a cloud server, often suffices for their reliable and efficient execution. However, task allocation in this streamlined architecture is challenging due to device limitations and diverse operating conditions. Given the inherent criticality of such workflow applications, where reliability and latency are vital yet conflicting objectives, an exact task allocation approach is typically required to ensure optimal solutions. As no existing method holistically addresses these issues, we propose an exact multi-objective task allocation framework to jointly optimize the overall reliability and latency of a workflow application in the specific edge-hub-cloud architecture. We present a comprehensive binary integer linear programming formulation that considers the relative importance of each objective. It incorporates time redundancy techniques, while accounting for crucial constraints often overlooked in related studies. We evaluate our approach using a relevant real-world workflow application, as well as synthetic workflows varying in structure, size, and criticality. In the real-world application, our method achieved average improvements of 84.19% in reliability and 49.81% in latency over baseline strategies, across relevant objective trade-offs. Overall, the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of our approach across diverse workflow applications for the considered system architecture, highlighting its practicality with runtimes averaging between 0.03 and 50.94 seconds across all examined workflows.

Abstract: Locally checkable labeling problems (LCLs) form the foundation of the modern theory of distributed graph algorithms. First introduced in the seminal paper by Naor and Stockmeyer [STOC 1993], these are graph problems that can be described by listing a finite set of valid local neighborhoods. This seemingly simple definition strikes a careful balance between two objectives: they are a family of problems that is broad enough so that it captures numerous problems that are of interest to researchers working in this field, yet restrictive enough so that it is possible to prove strong theorems that hold for all LCL problems. In particular, the distributed complexity landscape of LCL problems is now very well understood.
  In this work we show that the family of LCL problems is extremely robust to variations. We present a very restricted family of locally checkable problems (essentially, the "node-edge checkable" formalism familiar from round elimination, restricted to regular unlabeled graphs); most importantly, such problems cannot directly refer to e.g. the existence of short cycles. We show that one can translate between the two formalisms (there are local reductions in both directions that only need access to a symmetry-breaking oracle, and hence the overhead is at most an additive $O(\log^* n)$ rounds in the LOCAL model).

Abstract: The environmental sustainability of Information Technology (IT) has emerged as a critical concern, driven by the need to reduce both energy consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In the context of cloud-native applications deployed across the cloud-edge continuum, this challenge translates into identifying energy-efficient deployment strategies that consider not only the computational demands of application components but also the environmental impact of the nodes on which they are executed. Generating deployment plans that account for these dynamic factors is non-trivial, due to fluctuations in application behaviour and variations in the carbon intensity of infrastructure nodes. In this paper, we present an approach for the automatic generation of deployment plans guided by green constraints. These constraints are derived from a continuous analysis of energy consumption patterns, inter-component communication, and the environmental characteristics of the underlying infrastructure. This paper introduces a methodology and architecture for the generation of a set of green-aware constraints that inform the scheduler to produce environmentally friendly deployment plans. We demonstrate how these constraints can be automatically learned and updated over time using monitoring data, enabling adaptive, energy-aware orchestration. The proposed approach is validated through realistic deployment scenarios of a cloud-native application, showcasing its effectiveness in reducing energy usage and associated emissions.
