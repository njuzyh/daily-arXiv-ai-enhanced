Although prior work exploits weight dependent MAC power for compression, existing methods often use global activation models, coarse energy proxies, or layer-agnostic policies, which limits their effectiveness on real hardware. We propose an energy aware, layer-wise compression framework that explicitly leverages MAC and layer level energy characteristics. First, we build a layer-aware MAC energy model that combines per-layer activation statistics with an MSB-Hamming distance grouping of 22-bit partial sum transitions, and integrate it with a tile-level systolic mapping to estimate convolution-layer energy. On top of this model, we introduce an energy accuracy co-optimized weight selection algorithm within quantization aware training and an energy-prioritized layer-wise schedule that compresses high energy layers more aggressively under a global accuracy constraint. Experiments on different CNN models demonstrate up to 58.6\\% energy reduction with 2-3\\% accuracy drop, outperforming a state-of-the-art power-aware baseline.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "challenges": "Challenges extraction failed", "contributions": "Contributions extraction failed", "results": "Results analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed", "related_work": "Related work extraction failed"}}

Massive-scale AI models, which mimic the human brain's functionality, typically feature millions and even billions of parameters through data-intensive matrix multiplication tasks. While conventional Von-Neumann architectures struggle with the memory wall and the end of Moore's Law, these AI applications are migrating rapidly towards the edge, such as in robotics and unmanned aerial vehicles for surveillance, thereby adding more constraints to the hardware budget of AI architectures at the edge. Although in-memory computing has been proposed as a promising solution for the memory wall, both analog and digital in-memory computing architectures suffer from substantial degradation of the proposed benefits due to various design limitations. We propose a new digital in-memory stochastic computing architecture, DISCA, utilizing a compressed version of the quasi-stochastic Bent-Pyramid data format. DISCA inherits the same computational simplicity of analog computing, while preserving the same scalability, productivity, and reliability of digital systems. Post-layout modeling results of DISCA show an energy efficiency of 3.59 TOPS/W per bit at 500 MHz using a commercial 180nm CMOS technology.

As a result, Uplink MIMO (UL-MIMO) and Uplink Carrier Aggregation (UL-CA) have been widely deployed for the first time on commercial 5G networks. UL-MIMO enables the transmission of two data streams on one frequency band in strong RF conditions, theoretically doubling throughput and efficiency. On the other hand, UL-CA allows for simultaneous upload on greater channel widths, allowing more resources to be assigned to a single UE for higher throughput. In the United States, T-Mobile USA, a mobile network operator (MNO), has deployed network-wide 5G Standalone (SA), along with UL-MIMO on Time Division Duplex (TDD) band n41 and UL-CA between TDD and Frequency Division Duplex (FDD) NR bands. In this paper, the uplink throughput performance of UL-MIMO and UL-CA will be evaluated on the commercial T-Mobile 5G network on a variety of RF environments and modes of transportation. It was found that, even with the efficiency gains, UL-MIMO yields slower uplink throughput in most scenarios.

Various sketch-based algorithms have been proposed to estimate properties of traffic such as frequency, with lower memory usage and theoretical bounds, but they often under perform with the skewed distribution of network traffic. In this work, we propose an algorithm for top-K identification using a modified TowerSketch and a priority queue array. Tested on real traffic traces, we identify the top-K flows, with K up to 32,768, with a precision of more than 0.94, and estimate their frequency with an average relative error under 1.96%.

Using Stochastic Reward Nets, we model a Cloud service monitored by a performance anomaly detector. Using our model, we study the impact of detector characteristics, namely precision, recall and inspection frequency, on the average latency and resource consumption of the monitored service. Our results show that achieving a high precision and a high recall is not always necessary.

In practice, network delay variation and recovery dynamics at the receiver distort this cadence even when transports deliver all packets correctly, which produces visible jitter, stalls, and unstable playback.\n  We present a lightweight receiver-side scheduling approach that regularizes release timing after recovery. The scheduler maintains an adaptive estimate of effective path delay and adjusts release times asymmetrically, responding quickly to late arrivals and only gradually to early ones. This upper-envelope behavior keeps release aligned with recent delay peaks and maintains smooth playback with minimal added latency. The scheduler runs entirely on the receiver clock and requires no feedback or synchronization.\n  As a concrete example, we integrate receiver-side scheduling into the BitRipple Tunnel (BRT) overlay, an application-layer software system that forwards traffic without altering the underlying transport protocol. Within BRT, the scheduler functions as an independent module that regulates delivery timing for forwarded objects.\n  Evaluating BRT with receiver-side scheduling on a cloud-gaming workload shows that the scheduler removes virtually all large jitter excursions and yields tightly clustered release intervals that improve visible smoothness. Broader latency improvements arise from the behavior of the full BRT overlay. Receiver-side scheduling can also be integrated modularly into transport stacks such as TCP, QUIC, WebRTC, UDP, or RTP, which are natural deployment points for future work.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "challenges": "Challenges extraction failed", "contributions": "Contributions extraction failed", "results": "Results analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed", "related_work": "Related work extraction failed"}}

This work introduces a new paradigm with a core objective: to perform fast, data-efficient, and high-fidelity RF reconstruction of occluded 3D static scenes, using only a single, brief human walk. We argue that this unstructured motion is not noise, but is in fact an information-rich signal available for reconstruction. To achieve this, we design a factorization framework based on composite 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) that learns to model the dynamic effects of human motion from the persistent static scene geometry within a raw RF stream. Trained on just a single 60-second casual walk, our model reconstructs the full static scene with a Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) of 0.96, remarkably outperforming heavily-sampled state-of-the-art (SOTA) by 12%.
