The\nK-factor increases from approximately 5 dB at low altitudes to over 15 dB at\nhigher elevations, indicating stronger LoS dominance. Non-stationarity patterns\nare highly trajectory- and geometry-dependent, with azimuth most affected in\nhorizontal flights and elevation during vertical flight. These findings offer\nvaluable insights for modeling and improving UAV communication channels in 6G\nNon-Terrestrial Networks (NTNs)."}

The main contribution of this work is the proposal of a novel\nmetric to measure network sovereignty, the Cut Set Coloring (CSC) score. Based\non the CSC core metric CSC-ILP, our Integer Linear Program formulation is\npresented to maximize network sovereignty. We compare CSC-ILP's performance\nwith state of the art manufacturer assignment strategies."}
